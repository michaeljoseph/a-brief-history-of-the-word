<meta name="description" content="An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense intuitive linear view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century -- it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The returns, such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to The Singularity -- technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.">

								<p>An analysis of the history of technology shows that 
technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 
âintuitive linearâ view. So we wonât experience 100 years of progress in
 the 21st century â it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at 
todayâs rate). The âreturns,â such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness,
 also increase exponentially. Thereâs even exponential growth in the 
rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence 
will surpass human intelligence, leading to The Singularity â 
technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in 
the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of 
biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based 
humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the
 universe at the speed of light.</p>

						<p>You will get $40 trillion just by reading this essay and 
understanding what it says. For complete details, see below. (Itâs true 
that authors will do just about anything to keep your attention, but Iâm
 serious about this statement. Until I return to a further explanation, 
however, do read the first sentence of this paragraph carefully.)</p>
<p>Now back to the future: itâs widely misunderstood. Our forebears 
expected the future to be pretty much like their present, which had been
 pretty much like their past. Although exponential trends did exist a 
thousand years ago, they were at that very early stage where an 
exponential trend is so flat that it looks like no trend at all. So 
their lack of expectations was largely fulfilled. Today, in accordance 
with the common wisdom, everyone expects continuous technological 
progress and the social repercussions that follow. But the future will 
be far more surprising than most observers realize: few have truly 
internalized the implications of the fact that the rate of change itself
 is accelerating.<span id="more-80467"></span></p>
<h2>The Intuitive Linear View versus the Historical Exponential View</h2>
<p>Most long range forecasts of technical feasibility in future time 
periods dramatically underestimate the power of future technology 
because they are based on what I call the âintuitive linearâ view of 
technological progress rather than the âhistorical exponential view.â To
 express this another way, it is not the case that we will experience a 
hundred years of progress in the twenty-first century; rather we will 
witness on the order of twenty thousand years of progress (at <em>todayâs</em> rate of progress, that is).</p>
<p>This disparity in outlook comes up frequently in a variety of 
contexts, for example, the discussion of the ethical issues that Bill 
Joy raised in his controversial WIRED cover story, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html" target="_new">Why The Future Doesnât Need Us</a>.
 Bill and I have been frequently paired in a variety of venues as 
pessimist and optimist respectively. Although Iâm expected to criticize 
Billâs position, and indeed I do take issue with his prescription of 
relinquishment, I nonetheless usually end up defending Joy on the key 
issue of feasibility. Recently a Noble Prize winning panelist dismissed 
Billâs concerns, exclaiming that, âweâre not going to see 
self-replicating nanoengineered entities for a hundred years.â I pointed
 out that 100 years was indeed a reasonable estimate of the amount of 
technical progress required to achieve this particular milestone <em>at todayâs rate of progress</em>. But because weâre doubling the rate of progress every decade, weâll see a century of progressâ<em>at todayâs rate</em>âin only 25 calendar years.</p>
<p>When people think of a future period, they intuitively assume that 
the current rate of progress will continue for future periods. However, 
careful consideration of the pace of technology shows that the rate of 
progress is not constant, but it is human nature to adapt to the 
changing pace, so the intuitive view is that the pace will continue at 
the current rate. Even for those of us who have been around long enough 
to experience how the pace increases over time, our unexamined intuition
 nonetheless provides the impression that progress changes at the rate 
that we have experienced recently. From the mathematicianâs perspective,
 a primary reason for this is that an exponential curve approximates a 
straight line when viewed for a brief duration. So even though the rate 
of progress in the very recent past (e.g., this past year) is far 
greater than it was ten years ago (let alone a hundred or a thousand 
years ago), our memories are nonetheless dominated by our very recent 
experience. It is typical, therefore, that even sophisticated 
commentators, when considering the future, extrapolate the current pace 
of change over the next 10 years or 100 years to determine their 
expectations. This is why I call this way of looking at the future the 
âintuitive linearâ view.</p>
<p>But a serious assessment of the history of technology shows that 
technological change is exponential. In exponential growth, we find that
 a key measurement such as computational power is multiplied by a 
constant factor for each unit of time (e.g., doubling every year) rather
 than just being added to incrementally. Exponential growth is a feature
 of any evolutionary process, of which technology is a primary example. 
One can examine the data</p>
<p>in different ways, on different time scales, and for a wide variety 
of technologies ranging from electronic to biological, and the 
acceleration of progress and growth applies. Indeed, we find not just 
simple exponential growth, but âdoubleâ exponential growth, meaning that
 the rate of exponential growth is itself growing exponentially. These 
observations do not rely merely on an assumption of the continuation of 
Mooreâs law (i.e., the exponential shrinking of transistor sizes on an 
integrated circuit), but is based on a rich model of diverse 
technological processes. What it clearly shows is that technology, 
particularly the pace of technological change, advances (at least) 
exponentially, not linearly, and has been doing so since the advent of 
technology, indeed since the advent of evolution on Earth.</p>
<p>I emphasize this point because it is the most important failure that 
would-be prognosticators make in considering future trends. Most 
technology forecasts ignore altogether this âhistorical exponential 
viewâ of technological progress. That is why people tend to overestimate
 what can be achieved in the short term (because we tend to leave out 
necessary details), but underestimate what can be achieved in the long 
term (because the exponential growth is ignored).</p>
<h2>The Law of Accelerating Returns</h2>
<p>We can organize these observations into what I call the law of accelerating returns as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution applies positive feedback in that the more capable methods
 resulting from one stage of evolutionary progress are used to create 
the next stage. As a result, the</li>
<li>rate of progress of an evolutionary process increases exponentially 
over time. Over time, the âorderâ of the information embedded in the 
evolutionary process (i.e., the measure of how well the information fits
 a purpose, which in evolution is survival) increases.</li>
<li>A correlate of the above observation is that the âreturnsâ of an 
evolutionary process (e.g., the speed, cost-effectiveness, or overall 
âpowerâ of a process) increase exponentially over time.</li>
<li>In another positive feedback loop, as a particular evolutionary 
process (e.g., computation) becomes more effective (e.g., cost 
effective), greater resources are deployed toward the further progress 
of that process. This results in a second level of exponential growth 
(i.e., the rate of exponential growth itself grows exponentially).</li>
<li>Biological evolution is one such evolutionary process.</li>
<li>Technological evolution is another such evolutionary process. 
Indeed, the emergence of the first technology creating species resulted 
in the new evolutionary process of technology. Therefore, technological 
evolution is an outgrowth ofâand a continuation ofâbiological evolution.</li>
<li>A specific paradigm (a method or approach to solving a problem, 
e.g., shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit as an approach to 
making more powerful computers) provides exponential growth until the 
method exhausts its potential. When this happens, a paradigm shift 
(i.e., a fundamental change in the approach) occurs, which enables 
exponential growth to continue.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we apply these principles at the highest level of evolution on 
Earth, the first step, the creation of cells, introduced the paradigm of
 biology. The subsequent emergence of DNA provided a digital method to 
record the results of evolutionary experiments. Then, the evolution of a
 species who combined rational thought with an opposable appendage 
(i.e., the thumb) caused a fundamental paradigm shift from biology to 
technology. The upcoming primary paradigm shift will be from biological 
thinking to a hybrid combining biological and nonbiological thinking. 
This hybrid will include âbiologically inspiredâ processes resulting 
from the reverse engineering of biological brains.</p>
<p>If we examine the timing of these steps, we see that the process has 
continuously accelerated. The evolution of life forms required billions 
of years for the first steps (e.g., primitive cells); later on progress 
accelerated. During the Cambrian explosion, major paradigm shifts took 
only tens of millions of years. Later on, Humanoids developed over a 
period of millions of years, and Homo sapiens over a period of only 
hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>With the advent of a technology-creating species, the exponential 
pace became too fast for evolution through DNA-guided protein synthesis 
and moved on to human-created technology. Technology goes beyond mere 
tool making; it is a process of creating ever more powerful technology 
using the tools from the previous round of innovation. In this way, 
human technology is distinguished from the tool making of other species.
 There is a record of each stage of technology, and each new stage of 
technology builds on the order of the previous stage.</p>
<p>The first technological steps-sharp edges, fire, the wheelâtook tens 
of thousands of years. For people living in this era, there was little 
noticeable technological change in even a thousand years. By 1000 A.D., 
progress was much faster and a paradigm shift required only a century or
 two. In the nineteenth century, we saw more technological change than 
in the nine centuries preceding it. Then in the first twenty years of 
the twentieth century, we saw more advancement than in all of the 
nineteenth century. Now, paradigm shifts occur in only a few years time.
 The World Wide Web did not exist in anything like its present form just
 a few years ago; it didnât exist at all a decade ago.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart01.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>The paradigm shift rate (i.e., the overall rate of technical 
progress) is currently doubling (approximately) every decade; that is, 
paradigm shift times are halving every decade (and the rate of 
acceleration is itself growing exponentially). So, the technological 
progress in the twenty-first century will be equivalent to what would 
require (in the linear view) on the order of 200 centuries. In contrast,
 the twentieth century saw only about 25 years of progress (again at 
todayâs rate of progress) since we have been speeding up to current 
rates. So the twenty-first century will see almost a thousand times 
greater technological change than its predecessor.<br>

<h2>The Singularity Is Near</h2>
<p>To appreciate the nature and significance of the coming 
âsingularity,â it is important to ponder the nature of exponential 
growth. Toward this end, I am fond of telling the tale of the inventor 
of chess and his patron, the emperor of China. In response to the 
emperorâs offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked
 for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second 
square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this 
seemingly benign and humble request. One version of the story has the 
emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million
 trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this 
requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, 
oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing 
his head.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that as the emperor and the inventor went 
through the first half of the chess board, things were fairly 
uneventful. The inventor was given spoonfuls of rice, then bowls of 
rice, then barrels. By the end of the first half of the chess board, the
 inventor had accumulated one large fieldâs worth (4 billion grains), 
and the emperor did start to take notice. It was as they progressed 
through the second half of the chessboard that the situation quickly 
deteriorated. Incidentally, with regard to the doublings of computation,
 thatâs about where we stand nowâthere have been slightly more than 32 
doublings of performance since the first programmable computers were 
invented during World War II.</p>
<p>This is the nature of exponential growth. Although technology grows 
in the exponential domain, we humans live in a linear world. So 
technological trends are not noticed as small levels of technological 
power are doubled. Then seemingly out of nowhere, a technology explodes 
into view. For example, when the Internet went from 20,000 to 80,000 
nodes over a two year period during the 1980s, this progress remained 
hidden from the general public. A decade later, when it went from 20 
million to 80 million nodes in the same amount of time, the impact was 
rather conspicuous.</p>
<p>As exponential growth continues to accelerate into the first half of 
the twenty-first century, it will appear to explode into infinity, at 
least from the limited and linear perspective of contemporary humans. 
The progress will ultimately become so fast that it will rupture our 
ability to follow it. It will literally get out of our control. The 
illusion that we have our hand âon the plug,â will be dispelled.</p>
<p>Can the pace of technological progress continue to speed up 
indefinitely? Is there not a point where humans are unable to think fast
 enough to keep up with it? With regard to unenhanced humans, clearly 
so. But what would a thousand scientists, each a thousand times more 
intelligent than human scientists today, and each operating a thousand 
times faster than contemporary humans (because the information 
processing in their primarily nonbiological brains is faster) 
accomplish? One year would be like a millennium. What would they come up
 with?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, they would come up with technology to become 
even more intelligent (because their intelligence is no longer of fixed 
capacity). They would change their own thought processes to think even 
faster. When the scientists evolve to be a million times more 
intelligent and operate a million times faster, then an hour would 
result in a century of progress (in todayâs terms).</p>
<p>This, then, is the Singularity. The Singularity is technological 
change so rapid and so profound that it represents a rupture in the 
fabric of human history. Some would say that we cannot comprehend the 
Singularity, at least with our current level of understanding, and that 
it is impossible, therefore, to look past its âevent horizonâ and make 
sense of what lies beyond.</p>
<p>My view is that despite our profound limitations of thought, 
constrained as we are today to a mere hundred trillion interneuronal 
connections in our biological brains, we nonetheless have sufficient 
powers of abstraction to make meaningful statements about the nature of 
life after the Singularity. Most importantly, it is my view that the 
intelligence that will emerge will continue to represent the human 
civilization, which is already a human-machine civilization. This will 
be the next step in evolution, the next high level paradigm shift.</p>
<p>To put the concept of Singularity into perspective, letâs explore the
 history of the word itself. Singularity is a familiar word meaning a 
unique event with profound implications. In mathematics, the term 
implies infinity, the explosion of value that occurs when dividing a 
constant by a number that gets closer and closer to zero. In physics, 
similarly, a singularity denotes an event or location of infinite power.
 At the center of a black hole, matter is so dense that its gravity is 
infinite. As nearby matter and energy are drawn into the black hole, an 
event horizon separates the region from the rest of the Universe. It 
constitutes a rupture in the fabric of space and time. The Universe 
itself is said to have begun with just such a Singularity.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, John Von Neumann was quoted as saying that âthe ever 
accelerating progress of technologyâ¦gives the appearance of approaching 
some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human
 affairs, as we know them, could not continue.â In the 1960s, I. J. Good
 wrote of an âintelligence explosion,â resulting from intelligent 
machines designing their next generation without human intervention. In 
1986, Vernor Vinge, a mathematician and computer scientist at San Diego 
State University, wrote about a rapidly approaching technological 
âsingularityâ in his science fiction novel, <em>Marooned in Realtime.</em>
 Then in 1993, Vinge presented a paper to a NASA-organized symposium 
which described the Singularity as an impending event resulting 
primarily from the advent of âentities with greater than human 
intelligence,â which Vinge saw as the harbinger of a run-away 
phenomenon.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the Singularity has many faces. It represents 
the nearly vertical phase of exponential growth where the rate of growth
 is so extreme that technology appears to be growing at infinite speed. 
Of course, from a mathematical perspective, there is no discontinuity, 
no rupture, and the growth rates remain finite, albeit extraordinarily 
large. But from our <em>currently</em> limited perspective, this 
imminent event appears to be an acute and abrupt break in the continuity
 of progress. However, I emphasize the word âcurrently,â because one of 
the salient implications of the Singularity will be a change in the 
nature of our ability to understand. In other words, we will become 
vastly smarter as we merge with our technology.</p>
<p>When I wrote my first book, <em>The </em>Age of Intelligent Machines,
 in the 1980s, I ended the book with the specter of the emergence of 
machine intelligence greater than human intelligence, but found it 
difficult to look beyond this event horizon. Now having thought about 
its implications for the past 20 years, I feel that we are indeed 
capable of understanding the many facets of this threshold, one that 
will transform all spheres of human life.</p>
<p>Consider a few examples of the implications. The bulk of our 
experiences will shift from real reality to virtual reality. Most of the
 intelligence of our civilization will ultimately be nonbiological, 
which by the end of this century will be trillions of trillions of times
 more powerful than human intelligence. However, to address often 
expressed concerns, this does not imply the end of biological 
intelligence, even if thrown from its perch of evolutionary superiority.
 Moreover, it is important to note that the nonbiological forms will be 
derivative of biological design. In other words, our civilization will 
remain human, indeed in many ways more exemplary of what we regard as 
human than it is today, although our understanding of the term will move
 beyond its strictly biological origins.</p>
<p>Many observers have nonetheless expressed alarm at the emergence of 
forms of nonbiological intelligence superior to human intelligence. The 
potential to augment our own intelligence through intimate connection 
with other thinking mediums does not necessarily alleviate the concern, 
as some people have expressed the wish to remain âunenhancedâ while at 
the same time keeping their place at the top of the intellectual food 
chain. My view is that the likely outcome is that on the one hand, from 
the perspective of biological humanity, these superhuman intelligences 
will appear to be their transcendent servants, satisfying their needs 
and desires. On the other hand, fulfilling the wishes of a revered 
biological legacy will occupy only a trivial portion of the intellectual
 power that the Singularity will bring.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the Singularity will transform all aspects of our 
lives, social, sexual, and economic, which I explore herewith.</p>
<h2>Wherefrom Mooreâs Law</h2>
<p>Before considering further the implications of the Singularity, letâs
 examine the wide range of technologies that are subject to the law of 
accelerating returns. The exponential trend that has gained the greatest
 public recognition has become known as âMooreâs Law.â Gordon Moore, one
 of the inventors of integrated circuits, and then Chairman of Intel, 
noted in the mid 1970s that we could squeeze twice as many transistors 
on an integrated circuit every 24 months. Given that the electrons have 
less distance to travel, the circuits also run twice as fast, providing 
an overall quadrupling of computational power.</p>
<p>After sixty years of devoted service, Mooreâs Law will die a 
dignified death no later than the year 2019. By that time, transistor 
features will be just a few atoms in width, and the strategy of ever 
finer photolithography will have run its course. So, will that be the 
end of the exponential growth of computing?</p>
<p>Donât bet on it.</p>
<p>If we plot the speed (in instructions per second) per $1000 (in 
constant dollars) of 49 famous calculators and computers spanning the 
entire twentieth century, we note some interesting observations.</p>
<h2>Mooreâs Law Was Not the First, but the Fifth Paradigm To Provide Exponential Growth of Computing</h2>
<p>Each time one paradigm runs out of steam, another picks up the pace<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart03.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>It is important to note that Mooreâs Law of Integrated Circuits was 
not the first, but the fifth paradigm to provide accelerating 
price-performance. Computing devices have been consistently multiplying 
in power (per unit of time) from the mechanical calculating devices used
 in the 1890 U.S. Census, to Turingâs relay-based âRobinsonâ machine 
that cracked the Nazi enigma code, to the CBS vacuum tube computer that 
predicted the election of Eisenhower, to the transistor-based machines 
used in the first space launches, to the integrated-circuit-based 
personal computer which I used to dictate (and automatically transcribe)
 this essay.</p>
<p>But I noticed something else surprising. When I plotted the 49 
machines on an exponential graph (where a straight line means 
exponential growth), I didnât get a straight line. What I got was 
another exponential curve. In other words, thereâs exponential growth in
 the rate of exponential growth. Computer speed (per unit cost) doubled 
every three years between 1910 and 1950, doubled every two years between
 1950 and 1966, and is now doubling every year.</p>
<p>But where does Mooreâs Law come from? What is behind this remarkably 
predictable phenomenon? I have seen relatively little written about the 
ultimate source of this trend. Is it just âa set of industry 
expectations and goals,â as Randy Isaac, head of basic science at IBM 
contends? Or is there something more profound going on?</p>
<p>In my view, it is one manifestation (among many) of the exponential 
growth of the evolutionary process that is technology. The exponential 
growth of computing is a marvelous quantitative example of the 
exponentially growing returns from an evolutionary process. We can also 
express the exponential growth of computing in terms of an accelerating 
pace: it took ninety years to achieve the first MIPS (million 
instructions per second) per thousand dollars, now we add one MIPS per 
thousand dollars every day.</p>
<p>Mooreâs Law narrowly refers to the number of transistors on an 
integrated circuit of fixed size, and sometimes has been expressed even 
more narrowly in terms of transistor feature size. But rather than 
feature size (which is only one contributing factor), or even number of 
transistors, I think the most appropriate measure to track is 
computational speed per unit cost. This takes into account many levels 
of âclevernessâ (i.e., innovation, which is to say, technological 
evolution). In addition to all of the innovation in integrated circuits,
 there are multiple layers of innovation in computer design, e.g., 
pipelining, parallel processing, instruction look-ahead, instruction and
 memory caching, and many others.</p>
<p>From the above chart, we see that the exponential growth of computing
 didnât start with integrated circuits (around 1958), or even 
transistors (around 1947), but goes back to the electromechanical 
calculators used in the 1890 and 1900 U.S. Census. This chart spans at 
least five distinct paradigms of computing, of which Mooreâs Law 
pertains to only the latest one.</p>
<p>Itâs obvious what the sixth paradigm will be after Mooreâs Law runs 
out of steam during the second decade of this century. Chips today are 
flat (although it does require up to 20 layers of material to produce 
one layer of circuitry). Our brain, in contrast, is organized in three 
dimensions. We live in a three dimensional world, why not use the third 
dimension? The human brain actually uses a very inefficient 
electrochemical digital controlled analog computational process. The 
bulk of the calculations are done in the interneuronal connections at a 
speed of only about 200 calculations per second (in each connection), 
which is about ten million times slower than contemporary electronic 
circuits. But the brain gains its prodigious powers from its extremely 
parallel organization <em>in three dimensions</em>. There are many 
technologies in the wings that build circuitry in three dimensions. 
Nanotubes, for example, which are already working in laboratories, build
 circuits from pentagonal arrays of carbon atoms. One cubic inch of 
nanotube circuitry would be a million times more powerful than the human
 brain. There are more than enough new computing technologies now being 
researched, including three-dimensional silicon chips, optical 
computing, crystalline computing, DNA computing, and quantum computing, 
to keep the law of accelerating returns as applied to computation going 
for a long time.</p>
<p>Thus the (double) exponential growth of computing is broader than 
Mooreâs Law, which refers to only one of its paradigms. And this 
accelerating growth of computing is, in turn, part of the yet broader 
phenomenon of the accelerating pace of any evolutionary process. 
Observers are quick to criticize extrapolations of an exponential trend 
on the basis that the trend is bound to run out of âresources.â The 
classical example is when a species happens upon a new habitat (e.g., 
rabbits in Australia), the speciesâ numbers will grow exponentially for a
 time, but then hit a limit when resources such as food and space run 
out.</p>
<p>But the resources underlying the exponential growth of an evolutionary process are relatively unbounded:</p>
<ol>
<li>(i) The (ever growing) order of the evolutionary process itself. 
Each stage of evolution provides more powerful tools for the next. In 
biological evolution, the advent of DNA allowed more powerful and faster
 evolutionary âexperiments.â Later, setting the âdesignsâ of animal body
 plans during the Cambrian explosion allowed rapid evolutionary 
development of other body organs such as the brain. Or to take a more 
recent example, the advent of computer assisted design tools allows 
rapid development of the next generation of computers.</li>
<li>(ii) The âchaosâ of the environment in which the evolutionary 
process takes place and which provides the options for further 
diversity. In biological evolution, diversity enters the process in the 
form of mutations and ever changing environmental conditions. In 
technological evolution, human ingenuity combined with ever changing 
market conditions keep the process of innovation going.</li>
</ol>
<p>The maximum potential of matter and energy to contain intelligent 
processes is a valid issue. But according to my models, we wonât 
approach those limits during this century (but this will become an issue
 within a couple of centuries).</p>
<p>We also need to distinguish between the âSâ curve (an âSâ stretched 
to the right, comprising very slow, virtually unnoticeable 
growthâfollowed by very rapid growthâfollowed by a flattening out as the
 process approaches an asymptote) that is characteristic of any specific
 technological paradigm and the continuing exponential growth that is 
characteristic of the ongoing evolutionary process of technology. 
Specific paradigms, such as Mooreâs Law, do ultimately reach levels at 
which exponential growth is no longer feasible. Thus Mooreâs Law is an S
 curve. But the growth of computation is an ongoing exponential (at 
least until we âsaturateâ the Universe with the intelligence of our 
human-machine civilization, but that will not be a limit in this coming 
century). In accordance with the law of accelerating returns, paradigm 
shift, also called innovation, turns the S curve of any specific 
paradigm into a continuing exponential. A new paradigm (e.g., 
three-dimensional circuits) takes over when the old paradigm approaches 
its natural limit. This has already happened at least four times in the 
history of computation. This difference also distinguishes the tool 
making of non-human species, in which the mastery of a tool-making (or 
using) skill by each animal is characterized by an abruptly ending S 
shaped learning curve, versus human-created technology, which has 
followed an exponential pattern of growth and acceleration since its 
inception.</p>
<h2>DNA Sequencing, Memory, Communications, the Internet, and Miniaturization</h2>
<p>This âlaw of accelerating returnsâ applies to all of technology, 
indeed to any true evolutionary process, and can be measured with 
remarkable precision in information based technologies. There are a 
great many examples of the exponential growth implied by the law of 
accelerating returns in technologies as varied as DNA sequencing, 
communication speeds, electronics of all kinds, and even in the rapidly 
shrinking size of technology. The Singularity results not from the 
exponential explosion of computation alone, but rather from the 
interplay and myriad synergies that will result from manifold 
intertwined technological revolutions. Also, keep in mind that every 
point on the exponential growth curves underlying these panoply of 
technologies (see the graphs below) represents an intense human drama of
 innovation and competition. It is remarkable therefore that these 
chaotic processes result in such smooth and predictable exponential 
trends.</p>
<p>For example, when the human genome scan started fourteen years ago, 
critics pointed out that given the speed with which the genome could 
then be scanned, it would take thousands of years to finish the project.
 Yet the fifteen year project was nonetheless completed slightly ahead 
of schedule.<br>

<p>Of course, we expect to see exponential growth in electronic memories such as RAM.<br>

<h2>Notice How Exponential Growth Continued through Paradigm Shifts from Vacuum Tubes to Discrete Transistors to Integrated Circuits</h2>
<p>However, growth in magnetic memory is not primarily a matter of 
Mooreâs law, but includes advances in mechanical and electromagnetic 
systems.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart08.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>Exponential growth in communications technology has been even more 
explosive than in computation and is no less significant in its 
implications. Again, this progression involves far more than just 
shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit, but includes 
accelerating advances in fiber optics, optical switching, 
electromagnetic technologies, and others.<br>

<p>Notice Cascade of smaller âSâ Curves</p>
<p>Note that in the above two charts we can actually see the progression
 of âSâ curves: the acceleration fostered by a new paradigm, followed by
 a leveling off as the paradigm runs out of steam, followed by renewed 
acceleration through paradigm shift.<br>

<p>The following two charts show the overall growth of the Internet 
based on the number of hosts. These two charts plot the same data, but 
one is on an exponential axis and the other is linear. As I pointed out 
earlier, whereas technology progresses in the exponential domain, we 
experience it in the linear domain. So from the perspective of most 
observers, nothing was happening until the mid 1990s when seemingly out 
of nowhere, the world wide web and email exploded into view. But the 
emergence of the Internet into a worldwide phenomenon was readily 
predictable much earlier by examining the exponential trend data.<br>

<p><img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart14.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>Notice how the explosion of the Internet appears to be a surprise 
from the Linear Chart, but was perfectly predictable from the 
Exponential Chart</p>
<p>Ultimately we will get away from the tangle of wires in our cities 
and in our lives through wireless communication, the power of which is 
doubling every 10 to 11 months.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart15.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>Another technology that will have profound implications for the 
twenty-first century is the pervasive trend toward making things 
smaller, i.e., miniaturization. The salient implementation sizes of a 
broad range of technologies, both electronic and mechanical, are 
shrinking, also at a double exponential rate. At present, we are 
shrinking technology by a factor of approximately 5.6 per linear 
dimension per decade.<br>

<h2>The Exponential Growth of Computation Revisited</h2>
<p>If we view the exponential growth of computation in its proper 
perspective as one example of the pervasiveness of the exponential 
growth of information based technology, that is, as one example of many 
of the law of accelerating returns, then we can confidently predict its 
continuation.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart19.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>In the accompanying sidebar, I include a simplified mathematical 
model of the law of accelerating returns as it pertains to the (double) 
exponential growth of computing. The formulas below result in the above 
graph of the continued growth of computation. This graph matches the 
available data for the twentieth century through all five paradigms and 
provides projections for the twenty-first century. Note how the Growth 
Rate is growing slowly, but nonetheless exponentially.</p>
<h2>The Law of Accelerating Returns Applied to the Growth of Computation</h2>
<p>The following provides a brief overview of the law of accelerating 
returns as it applies to the double exponential growth of computation. 
This model considers the impact of the growing power of the technology 
to foster its own next generation. For example, with more powerful 
computers and related technology, we have the tools and the knowledge to
 design yet more powerful computers, and to do so more quickly.</p>
<p>Note that the data for the year 2000 and beyond assume neural net 
connection calculations as it is expected that this type of calculation 
will ultimately dominate, particularly in emulating human brain 
functions. This type of calculation is less expensive than conventional 
(e.g., Pentium III / IV) calculations by a factor of at least 100 
(particularly if implemented using digital controlled analog 
electronics, which would correspond well to the brainâs digital 
controlled analog electrochemical processes). A factor of 100 translates
 into approximately 6 years (today) and less than 6 years later in the 
twenty-first century.</p>
<p>My estimate of brain capacity is 100 billion neurons times an average
 1,000 connections per neuron (with the calculations taking place 
primarily in the connections) times 200 calculations per second. 
Although these estimates are conservatively high, one can find higher 
and lower estimates. However, even much higher (or lower) estimates by 
orders of magnitude only shift the prediction by a relatively small 
number of years.</p>
<p>Some prominent dates from this analysis include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We achieve one Human Brain capability (2 * 10^16 cps) for $1,000 around the year 2023.</li>
<li>We achieve one Human Brain capability (2 * 10^16 cps) for one cent around the year 2037.</li>
<li>We achieve one Human Race capability (2 * 10^26 cps) for $1,000 around the year 2049.</li>
<li>We achieve one Human Race capability (2 * 10^26 cps) for one cent around the year 2059.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Model considers the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>V: Velocity (i.e., power) of computing (measured in CPS/unit cost)</li>
<li>W: World Knowledge as it pertains to designing and building computational devices</li>
<li>t: Time</li>
</ul>
<p>The assumptions of the model are:</p>
<ol>
<li>(1) V = C1 * W</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, computer power is a linear function of the knowledge 
of how to build computers. This is actually a conservative assumption. 
In general, innovations improve V (computer power) by a multiple, not in
 an additive way. Independent innovations multiply each otherâs effect. 
For example, a circuit advance such as CMOS, a more efficient IC wiring 
methodology, and a processor innovation such as pipelining all increase V
 by independent multiples.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2) W = C2 * Integral (0 to t) V</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, W (knowledge) is cumulative, and the instantaneous increment to knowledge is proportional to V.</p>
<p>This gives us:</p>
<ul>
<li>W = C1 * C2 * Integral (0 to t) W</li>
<li>W = C1 * C2 * C3 ^ (C4 * t)</li>
<li>V = C1 ^ 2 * C2 * C3 ^ (C4 * t)</li>
<li>(Note on notation: a^b means a raised to the b power.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Simplifying the constants, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>V = Ca * Cb ^ (Cc * t)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is a formula for âacceleratingâ (i.e., exponentially growing) returns, a âregular Mooreâs Law.â</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the data shows exponential growth in the rate 
of exponential growth. (We doubled computer power every three years 
early in the twentieth century, every two years in the middle of the 
century, and close to every one year during the 1990s.)</p>
<p>Letâs factor in another exponential phenomenon, which is the growing 
resources for computation. Not only is each (constant cost) device 
getting more powerful as a function of W, but the resources deployed for
 computation are also growing exponentially.</p>
<p>We now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>N: Expenditures for computation</li>
<li>V = C1 * W (as before)</li>
<li>N = C4 ^ (C5 * t) (Expenditure for computation is growing at its own exponential rate)</li>
<li>W = C2 * Integral(0 to t) (N * V)</li>
</ul>
<p>As before, world knowledge is accumulating, and the instantaneous 
increment is proportional to the amount of computation, which equals the
 resources deployed for computation (N) * the power of each (constant 
cost) device.</p>
<p>This gives us:</p>
<ul>
<li>W = C1 * C2 * Integral(0 to t) (C4 ^ (C5 * t) * W)</li>
<li>W = C1 * C2 * (C3 ^ (C6 * t)) ^ (C7 * t)</li>
<li>V = C1 ^ 2 * C2 * (C3 ^ (C6 * t)) ^ (C7 * t)</li>
</ul>
<p>Simplifying the constants, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>V = Ca * (Cb ^ (Cc * t)) ^ (Cd * t)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a double exponentialâan exponential curve in which the rate 
of exponential growth is growing at a different exponential rate.</p>
<p>Now letâs consider real-world data. Considering the data for actual 
calculating devices and computers during the twentieth century:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPS/$1K: Calculations Per Second for $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Twentieth century computing data matches:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPS/$1K = 10^(6.00*((20.40/6.00)^((A13-1900)/100))-11.00)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can determine the growth rate over a period of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth Rate =10^((LOG(CPS/$1K for Current Year) â LOG(CPS/$1K for Previous Year))/(Current Year â Previous Year))</li>
<li>Human Brain = 100 Billion (10^11) neurons * 1000 (10^3) 
Connections/Neuron * 200 (2 * 10^2) Calculations Per Second Per 
Connection = 2 * 10^16 Calculations Per Second</li>
<li>Human Race = 10 Billion (10^10) Human Brains = 2 * 10^26 Calculations Per Second</li>
</ul>
<p>These formulas produce the graph above.</p>
<p>Already, IBMâs âBlue Geneâ supercomputer, now being built and 
scheduled to be completed by 2005, is projected to provide 1 million 
billion calculations per second (i.e., one billion megaflops). This is 
already one twentieth of the capacity of the human brain, which I 
estimate at a conservatively high 20 million billion calculations per 
second (100 billion neurons times 1,000 connections per neuron times 200
 calculations per second per connection). In line with my earlier 
predictions, supercomputers will achieve one human brain capacity by 
2010, and personal computers will do so by around 2020. By 2030, it will
 take a village of human brains (around a thousand) to match $1000 of 
computing. By 2050, $1000 of computing will equal the processing power 
of all human brains on Earth. Of course, this only includes those brains
 still using carbon-based neurons. While human neurons are wondrous 
creations in a way, we wouldnât (and donât) design computing circuits 
the same way. Our electronic circuits are already more than ten million 
times faster than a neuronâs electrochemical processes. Most of the 
complexity of a human neuron is devoted to maintaining its life support 
functions, not its information processing capabilities. Ultimately, we 
will need to port our mental processes to a more suitable computational 
substrate. Then our minds wonât have to stay so small, being constrained
 as they are today to a mere hundred trillion neural connections each 
operating at a ponderous 200 digitally controlled analog calculations 
per second.</p>
<h2>The Software of Intelligence</h2>
<p>So far, Iâve been talking about the hardware of computing. The 
software is even more salient. One of the principal assumptions 
underlying the expectation of the Singularity is the ability of 
nonbiological mediums to emulate the richness, subtlety, and depth of 
human thinking. Achieving the computational capacity of the human brain,
 or even villages and nations of human brains will not automatically 
produce human levels of capability. By human levels I include all the 
diverse and subtle ways in which humans are intelligent, including 
musical and artistic aptitude, creativity, physically moving through the
 world, and understanding and responding appropriately to emotion. The 
requisite hardware capacity is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
 The organization and content of these resourcesâthe software of 
intelligenceâis also critical.</p>
<p>Before addressing this issue, it is important to note that once a 
computer achieves a human level of intelligence, it will necessarily 
soar past it. A key advantage of nonbiological intelligence is that 
machines can easily share their knowledge. If I learn French, or read 
War and Peace, I canât readily download that learning to you. You have 
to acquire that scholarship the same painstaking way that I did. My 
knowledge, embedded in a vast pattern of neurotransmitter concentrations
 and interneuronal connections, cannot be quickly accessed or 
transmitted. But we wonât leave out quick downloading ports in our 
nonbiological equivalents of human neuron clusters. When one computer 
learns a skill or gains an insight, it can immediately share that wisdom
 with billions of other machines.</p>
<p>As a contemporary example, we spent years teaching one research 
computer how to recognize continuous human speech. We exposed it to 
thousands of hours of recorded speech, corrected its errors, and 
patiently improved its performance. Finally, it became quite adept at 
recognizing speech (I dictated most of my recent book to it). Now if you
 want your own personal computer to recognize speech, it doesnât have to
 go through the same process; you can just download the fully trained 
patterns in seconds. Ultimately, billions of nonbiological entities can 
be the master of all human and machine acquired knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, computers are potentially millions of times faster than 
human neural circuits. A computer can also remember billions or even 
trillions of facts perfectly, while we are hard pressed to remember a 
handful of phone numbers. The combination of human level intelligence in
 a machine with a computerâs inherent superiority in the speed, 
accuracy, and sharing ability of its memory will be formidable.</p>
<p>There are a number of compelling scenarios to achieve higher levels 
of intelligence in our computers, and ultimately human levels and 
beyond. We will be able to evolve and train a system combining massively
 parallel neural nets with other paradigms to understand language and 
model knowledge, including the ability to read and model the knowledge 
contained in written documents. Unlike many contemporary âneural netâ 
machines, which use mathematically simplified models of human neurons, 
some contemporary neural nets are already using highly detailed models 
of human neurons, including detailed nonlinear analog activation 
functions and other relevant details. Although the ability of todayâs 
computers to extract and learn knowledge from natural language documents
 is limited, their capabilities in this domain are improving rapidly. 
Computers will be able to read on their own, understanding and modeling 
what they have read, by the second decade of the twenty-first century. 
We can then have our computers read all of the worldâs literatureâbooks,
 magazines, scientific journals, and other available material. 
Ultimately, the machines will gather knowledge on their own by venturing
 out on the web, or even into the physical world, drawing from the full 
spectrum of media and information services, and sharing knowledge with 
each other (which machines can do far more easily than their human 
creators).</p>
<h2>Reverse Engineering the Human Brain</h2>
<p>The most compelling scenario for mastering the software of 
intelligence is to tap into the blueprint of the best example we can get
 our hands on of an intelligent process. There is no reason why we 
cannot reverse engineer the human brain, and essentially copy its 
design. Although it took its original designer several billion years to 
develop, itâs readily available to us, and not (yet) copyrighted. 
Although thereâs a skull around the brain, it is not hidden from our 
view.</p>
<p>The most immediately accessible way to accomplish this is through 
destructive scanning: we take a frozen brain, preferably one frozen just
 slightly before rather than slightly after it was going to die anyway, 
and examine one brain layerâone very thin sliceâat a time. We can 
readily see every neuron and every connection and every neurotransmitter
 concentration represented in each synapse-thin layer.</p>
<p>Human brain scanning has already started. A condemned killer allowed 
his brain and body to be scanned and you can access all 10 billion bytes
 of him on the Internet <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html" target="_new">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html</a>.</p>
<p>He has a 25 billion byte female companion on the site as well in case
 he gets lonely. This scan is not high enough in resolution for our 
purposes, but then, we probably donât want to base our templates of 
machine intelligence on the brain of a convicted killer, anyway.</p>
<p>But scanning a frozen brain is feasible today, albeit not yet at a 
sufficient speed or bandwidth, but again, the law of accelerating 
returns will provide the requisite speed of scanning, just as it did for
 the human genome scan. Carnegie Mellon Universityâs Andreas Nowatzyk 
plans to scan the nervous system of the brain and body of a mouse with a
 resolution of less than 200 nanometers, which is getting very close to 
the resolution needed for reverse engineering.</p>
<p>We also have noninvasive scanning techniques today, including 
high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, optical imaging,
 near-infrared scanning, and other technologies which are capable in 
certain instances of resolving individual somas, or neuron cell bodies. 
Brain scanning technologies are also increasing their resolution with 
each new generation, just what we would expect from the law of 
accelerating returns. Future generations will enable us to resolve the 
connections between neurons and to peer inside the synapses and record 
the neurotransmitter concentrations.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart20.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p><img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart21.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p><img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart22.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>We can peer inside someoneâs brain today with noninvasive scanners, 
which are increasing their resolution with each new generation of this 
technology. There are a number of technical challenges in accomplishing 
this, including achieving suitable resolution, bandwidth, lack of 
vibration, and safety. For a variety of reasons it is easier to scan the
 brain of someone recently deceased than of someone still living. It is 
easier to get someone deceased to sit still, for one thing. But 
noninvasively scanning a living brain will ultimately become feasible as
 MRI, optical, and other scanning technologies continue to improve in 
resolution and speed.</p>
<h2>Scanning from Inside</h2>
<p>Although noninvasive means of scanning the brain from outside the 
skull are rapidly improving, the most practical approach to capturing 
every salient neural detail will be to scan it from inside. By 2030, 
ânanobotâ (i.e., nano robot) technology will be viable, and brain 
scanning will be a prominent application. Nanobots are robots that are 
the size of human blood cells, or even smaller. Billions of them could 
travel through every brain capillary and scan every relevant feature 
from up close. Using high speed wireless communication, the nanobots 
would communicate with each other, and with other computers that are 
compiling the brain scan data base (in other words, the nanobots will 
all be on a wireless local area network).</p>
<p>This scenario involves only capabilities that we can touch and feel 
today. We already have technology capable of producing very high 
resolution scans, provided that the scanner is physically proximate to 
the neural features. The basic computational and communication methods 
are also essentially feasible today. The primary features that are not 
yet practical are nanobot size and cost. As I discussed above, we can 
project the exponentially declining cost of computation, and the rapidly
 declining size of both electronic and mechanical technologies. We can 
conservatively expect, therefore, the requisite nanobot technology by 
around 2030. Because of its ability to place each scanner in very close 
physical proximity to every neural feature, nanobot-based scanning will 
be more practical than scanning the brain from outside.</p>
<h2>How to Use Your Brain Scan</h2>
<p>How will we apply the thousands of trillions of bytes of information 
derived from each brain scan? One approach is to use the results to 
design more intelligent parallel algorithms for our machines, 
particularly those based on one of the neural net paradigms. With this 
approach, we donât have to copy every single connection. There is a 
great deal of repetition and redundancy within any particular brain 
region. Although the information contained in a human brain would 
require thousands of trillions of bytes of information (on the order of 
100 billion neurons times an average of 1,000 connections per neuron, 
each with multiple neurotransmitter concentrations and connection data),
 the design of the brain is characterized by a human genome of only 
about a billion bytes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the genome is redundant, so the initial design 
of the brain is characterized by approximately one hundred million 
bytes, about the size of Microsoft Word. Of course, the complexity of 
our brains greatly increases as we interact with the world (by a factor 
of more than ten million). Because of the highly repetitive patterns 
found in each specific brain region, it is not necessary to capture each
 detail in order to reverse engineer the significant digital-analog 
algorithms. With this information, we can design simulated nets that 
operate similarly. There are already multiple efforts under way to scan 
the human brain and apply the insights derived to the design of 
intelligent machines.</p>
<p>The pace of brain reverse engineering is only slightly behind the 
availability of the brain scanning and neuron structure information. A 
contemporary example is a comprehensive model of a significant portion 
of the human auditory processing system that Lloyd Watts (<a href="http://www.lloydwatts.com/" target="_new">www.lloydwatts.com</a>)
 has developed from both neurobiology studies of specific neuron types 
and brain interneuronal connection information. Wattsâ model includes 
five parallel paths and includes the actual intermediate representations
 of auditory information at each stage of neural processing. Watts has 
implemented his model as real-time software which can locate and 
identify sounds with many of the same properties as human hearing. 
Although a work in progress, the model illustrates the feasibility of 
converting neurobiological models and brain connection data into working
 simulations. Also, as Hans Moravec and others have speculated, these 
efficient simulations require about 1,000 times less computation than 
the theoretical potential of the biological neurons being simulated.</p>

<p>The brain is not one huge âtabula rasaâ (i.e., undifferentiated blank
 slate), but rather an intricate and intertwined collection of hundreds 
of specialized regions. The process of âpeeling the onionâ to understand
 these interleaved regions is well underway. As the requisite neuron 
models and brain interconnection data becomes available, detailed and 
implementable models such as the auditory example above will be 
developed for all brain regions.</p>
<p>After the algorithms of a region are understood, they can be refined 
and extended before being implemented in synthetic neural equivalents. 
For one thing, they can be run on a computational substrate that is 
already more than ten million times faster than neural circuitry. And we
 can also throw in the methods for building intelligent machines that we
 already understand.</p>
<h2>Downloading the Human Brain</h2>
<p>A more controversial application than this scanning-the-brain-to-understand-it scenario is <em>scanning-the-brain-to-</em>download<em>-it</em>.
 Here we scan someoneâs brain to map the locations, interconnections, 
and contents of all the somas, axons, dendrites, presynaptic vesicles, 
neurotransmitter concentrations, and other neural components and levels.
 Its entire organization can then be re-created on a neural computer of 
sufficient capacity, including the contents of its memory.</p>
<p>To do this, we need to understand local brain processes, although not
 necessarily all of the higher level processes. Scanning a brain with 
sufficient detail to download it may sound daunting, but so did the 
human genome scan. All of the basic technologies exist today, just not 
with the requisite speed, cost, and size, but these are the attributes 
that are improving at a double exponential pace.</p>
<p>The computationally pertinent aspects of individual neurons are 
complicated, but definitely not beyond our ability to accurately model. 
For example, Ted Berger and his colleagues at Hedco Neurosciences have 
built integrated circuits that precisely match the digital and analog 
information processing characteristics of neurons, including clusters 
with hundreds of neurons. Carver Mead and his colleagues at CalTech have
 built a variety of integrated circuits that emulate the digital-analog 
characteristics of mammalian neural circuits.</p>
<p>A recent experiment at San Diegoâs Institute for Nonlinear Science 
demonstrates the potential for electronic neurons to precisely emulate 
biological ones. Neurons (biological or otherwise) are a prime example 
of what is often called âchaotic computing.â Each neuron acts in an 
essentially unpredictable fashion. When an entire network of neurons 
receives input (from the outside world or from other networks of 
neurons), the signaling amongst them appears at first to be frenzied and
 random. Over time, typically a fraction of a second or so, the chaotic 
interplay of the neurons dies down, and a stable pattern emerges. This 
pattern represents the âdecisionâ of the neural network. If the neural 
network is performing a pattern recognition task (which, incidentally, 
comprises the bulk of the activity in the human brain), then the 
emergent pattern represents the appropriate recognition.</p>
<p>So the question addressed by the San Diego researchers was whether 
electronic neurons could engage in this chaotic dance alongside 
biological ones. They hooked up their artificial neurons with those from
 spiney lobsters in a single network, and their hybrid 
biological-nonbiological network performed in the same way (i.e., 
chaotic interplay followed by a stable emergent pattern) and with the 
same type of results as an all biological net of neurons. Essentially, 
the biological neurons accepted their electronic peers. It indicates 
that their mathematical model of these neurons was reasonably accurate.</p>
<p>There are many projects around the world which are creating 
nonbiological devices to recreate in great detail the functionality of 
human neuron clusters. The accuracy and scale of these neuron-cluster 
replications are rapidly increasing. We started with functionally 
equivalent recreations of single neurons, then clusters of tens, then 
hundreds, and now thousands. Scaling up technical processes at an 
exponential pace is what technology is good at.</p>
<p>As the computational power to emulate the human brain becomes 
availableâweâre not there yet, but we will be there within a couple of 
decadesâprojects already under way to scan the human brain will be 
accelerated, with a view both to understand the human brain in general, 
as well as providing a detailed description of the contents and design 
of specific brains. By the third decade of the twenty-first century, we 
will be in a position to create highly detailed and complete maps of all
 relevant features of all neurons, neural connections and synapses in 
the human brain, all of the neural details that play a role in the 
behavior and functionality of the brain, and to recreate these designs 
in suitably advanced neural computers.</p>
<h2>Is the Human Brain Different from a Computer?</h2>
<p>Is the human brain different from a computer?</p>
<p>The answer depends on what we mean by the word âcomputer.â Certainly 
the brain uses very different methods from conventional contemporary 
computers. Most computers today are all digital and perform one (or 
perhaps a few) computations at a time at extremely high speed. In 
contrast, the human brain combines digital and analog methods with most 
computations performed in the analog domain. The brain is massively 
parallel, performing on the order of a hundred trillion computations at 
the same time, but at extremely slow speeds.</p>
<p>With regard to digital versus analog computing, we know that digital 
computing can be functionally equivalent to analog computing (although 
the reverse is not true), so we can perform all of the capabilities of a
 hybrid digitalâanalog network with an all digital computer. On the 
other hand, there is an engineering advantage to analog circuits in that
 analog computing is potentially thousands of times more efficient. An 
analog computation can be performed by a few transistors, or, in the 
case of mammalian neurons, specific electrochemical processes. A digital
 computation, in contrast, requires thousands or tens of thousands of 
transistors. So there is a significant engineering advantage to 
emulating the brainâs analog methods.</p>
<p>The massive parallelism of the human brain is the key to its pattern 
recognition abilities, which reflects the strength of human thinking. As
 I discussed above, mammalian neurons engage in a chaotic dance, and if 
the neural network has learned its lessons well, then a stable pattern 
will emerge reflecting the networkâs decision. There is no reason why 
our nonbiological functionally equivalent recreations of biological 
neural networks cannot be built using these same principles, and indeed 
there are dozens of projects around the world that have succeeded in 
doing this. My own technical field is pattern recognition, and the 
projects that I have been involved in for over thirty years use this 
form of chaotic computing. Particularly successful examples are Carver 
Meadâs neural chips, which are highly parallel, use digital controlled 
analog computing, and are intended as functionally similar recreations 
of biological networks.</p>
<h2>Objective and Subjective</h2>
<p>The Singularity envisions the emergence of human-like intelligent 
entities of astonishing diversity and scope. Although these entities 
will be capable of passing the âTuring testâ (i.e., able to fool humans 
that they are human), the question arises as to whether these âpeopleâ 
are conscious, or just appear that way. To gain some insight as to why 
this is an extremely subtle question (albeit an ultimately important 
one) it is useful to consider some of the paradoxes that emerge from the
 concept of downloading specific human brains.</p>
<p>Although I anticipate that the most common application of the 
knowledge gained from reverse engineering the human brain will be 
creating more intelligent machines that are not necessarily modeled on 
specific biological human individuals, the scenario of scanning and 
reinstantiating all of the neural details of a <em>specific</em> person raises the most immediate questions of identity. Letâs consider the question of what we will find when we do this.</p>
<p>We have to consider this question on both the objective and 
subjective levels. âObjectiveâ means everyone except me, so letâs start 
with that. Objectively, when we scan someoneâs brain and reinstantiate 
their personal mind file into a suitable computing medium, the newly 
emergent âpersonâ will appear to other observers to have very much the 
same personality, history, and memory as the person originally scanned. 
That is, once the technology has been refined and perfected. Like any 
new technology, it wonât be perfect at first. But ultimately, the scans 
and recreations will be very accurate and realistic.</p>
<p>Interacting with the newly instantiated person will feel like 
interacting with the original person. The new person will claim to be 
that same old person and will have a memory of having been that person. 
The new person will have all of the patterns of knowledge, skill, and 
personality of the original. We are already creating functionally 
equivalent recreations of neurons and neuron clusters with sufficient 
accuracy that biological neurons accept their nonbiological equivalents 
and work with them as if they were biological. There are no natural 
limits that prevent us from doing the same with the hundred billion 
neuron cluster of clusters we call the human brain.</p>
<p>Subjectively, the issue is more subtle and profound, but first we 
need to reflect on one additional objective issue: our physical self.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Having a Body</h2>
<p>Consider how many of our thoughts and thinking are directed toward 
our body and its survival, security, nutrition, and image, not to 
mention affection, sexuality, and reproduction. Many, if not most, of 
the goals we attempt to advance using our brains have to do with our 
bodies: protecting them, providing them with fuel, making them 
attractive, making them feel good, providing for their myriad needs and 
desires. Some philosophers maintain that achieving human level 
intelligence is impossible without a body. If weâre going to port a 
humanâs mind to a new computational medium, weâd better provide a body. A
 disembodied mind will quickly get depressed.</p>
<p>There are a variety of bodies that we will provide for our machines, 
and that they will provide for themselves: bodies built through 
nanotechnology (i.e., building highly complex physical systems atom by 
atom), virtual bodies (that exist only in virtual reality), bodies 
comprised of swarms of nanobots, and other technologies.</p>
<p>A common scenario will be to enhance a personâs biological brain with
 intimate connection to nonbiological intelligence. In this case, the 
body remains the good old human body that weâre familiar with, although 
this too will become greatly enhanced through biotechnology (gene 
enhancement and replacement) and, later on, through nanotechnology. A 
detailed examination of twenty-first century bodies is beyond the scope 
of this essay, but recreating and enhancing our bodies will be (and has 
been) an easier task than recreating our minds.</p>
<h2>So Just Who Are These People?</h2>
<p>To return to the issue of subjectivity, consider: is the 
reinstantiated mind the same consciousness as the person we just 
scanned? Are these âpeopleâ conscious at all? Is this a mind or just a 
brain?</p>
<p>Consciousness in our twenty-first century machines will be a 
critically important issue. But it is not easily resolved, or even 
readily understood. People tend to have strong views on the subject, and
 often just canât understand how anyone else could possibly see the 
issue from a different perspective. Marvin Minsky observed that âthereâs
 something queer about describing consciousness. Whatever people mean to
 say, they just canât seem to make it clear.â</p>
<p>We donât worry, at least not yet, about causing pain and suffering to
 our computer programs. But at what point do we consider an entity, a 
process, to be conscious, to feel pain and discomfort, to have its own 
intentionality, its own free will? How do we determine if an entity is 
conscious; if it has subjective experience? How do we distinguish a 
process that is conscious from one that just acts <em>as if</em> it is conscious?</p>
<p>We canât simply ask it. If it says âHey Iâm conscious,â does that 
settle the issue? No, we have computer games today that effectively do 
that, and theyâre not terribly convincing.</p>
<p>How about if the entity <em>is</em> very convincing and compelling when it says âIâm lonely, please keep me company.â Does that settle the issue?</p>
<p>If we look inside its circuits, and see essentially the identical 
kinds of feedback loops and other mechanisms in its brain that we see in
 a human brain (albeit implemented using nonbiological equivalents), 
does that settle the issue?</p>
<p>And just who are these people in the machine, anyway? The answer will
 depend on who you ask. If you ask the people in the machine, they will 
strenuously claim to be the original persons. For example, if we 
scanâletâs say myselfâand record the exact state, level, and position of
 every neurotransmitter, synapse, neural connection, and every other 
relevant detail, and then reinstantiate this massive data base of 
information (which I estimate at thousands of trillions of bytes) into a
 neural computer of sufficient capacity, the person who then emerges in 
the machine will think that âheâ is (and had been) me, or at least he 
will act that way. He will say âI grew up in Queens, New York, went to 
college at MIT, stayed in the Boston area, started and sold a few 
artificial intelligence companies, walked into a scanner there, and woke
 up in the machine here. Hey, this technology really works.â</p>
<p>But wait.</p>
<p>Is this really me? For one thing, old biological Ray (thatâs me) 
still exists. Iâll still be here in my carbon-cell-based brain. Alas, I 
will have to sit back and watch the new Ray succeed in endeavors that I 
could only dream of.</p>
<h2>A Thought Experiment</h2>
<p>Letâs consider the issue of just who I am, and who the new Ray is a 
little more carefully. First of all, am I the stuff in my brain and 
body?</p>
<p>Consider that the particles making up my body and brain are 
constantly changing. We are not at all permanent collections of 
particles. The cells in our bodies turn over at different rates, but the
 particles (e.g., atoms and molecules) that comprise our cells are 
exchanged at a very rapid rate. I am just not the same collection of 
particles that I was even a month ago. It is the patterns of matter and 
energy that are semipermanent (that is, changing only gradually), but 
our actual material content is changing constantly, and very quickly. We
 are rather like the patterns that water makes in a stream. The rushing 
water around a formation of rocks makes a particular, unique pattern. 
This pattern may remain relatively unchanged for hours, even years. Of 
course, the actual material constituting the patternâthe waterâis 
replaced in milliseconds. The same is true for Ray Kurzweil. Like the 
water in a stream, my particles are constantly changing, but the pattern
 that people recognize as Ray has a reasonable level of continuity. This
 argues that we should not associate our fundamental identity with a 
specific set of particles, but rather the pattern of matter and energy 
that we represent. Many contemporary philosophers seem partial to this 
âidentify from patternâ argument.</p>
<p>But (again) wait.</p>
<p>If you were to scan my brain and reinstantiate new Ray while I was 
sleeping, I would not necessarily even know about it (with the nanobots,
 this will be a feasible scenario). If you then come to me, and say, 
âgood news, Ray, weâve successfully reinstantiated your mind file, so we
 wonât be needing your old brain anymore,â I may suddenly realize the 
flaw in this âidentity from patternâ argument. I may wish new Ray well, 
and realize that he shares my âpattern,â but I would nonetheless 
conclude that heâs not me, because Iâm still here. How could he be me? 
After all, I would not necessarily know that he even existed.</p>
<p>Letâs consider another perplexing scenario. Suppose I replace a small
 number of biological neurons with functionally equivalent nonbiological
 ones (they may provide certain benefits such as greater reliability and
 longevity, but thatâs not relevant to this thought experiment). After I
 have this procedure performed, am I still the same person? My friends 
certainly think so. I still have the same self-deprecating humor, the 
same silly grinâyes, Iâm still the same guy.</p>
<p>It should be clear where Iâm going with this. Bit by bit, region by 
region, I ultimately replace my entire brain with essentially identical 
(perhaps improved) nonbiological equivalents (preserving all of the 
neurotransmitter concentrations and other details that represent my 
learning, skills, and memories). At each point, I feel the procedures 
were successful. At each point, I feel that I am the same guy. After 
each procedure, I claim to be the same guy. My friends concur. There is 
no old Ray and new Ray, just one Ray, one that never appears to 
fundamentally change.</p>
<p>But consider this. This gradual replacement of my brain with a 
nonbiological equivalent is essentially identical to the following 
sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>(i) scan Ray and reinstantiate Rayâs mind file into new (nonbiological) Ray, and, then</li>
<li>(ii) terminate old Ray. But we concluded above that in such a 
scenario new Ray is not the same as old Ray. And if old Ray is 
terminated, well then thatâs the end of Ray. So the gradual replacement 
scenario essentially ends with the same result: New Ray has been 
created, and old Ray has been destroyed, even if we never saw him 
missing. So what appears to be the continuing existence of just one Ray 
is really the creation of new Ray and the termination of old Ray.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>On yet another hand</em> (weâre running out of philosophical 
hands here), the gradual replacement scenario is not altogether 
different from what happens normally to our biological selves, in that 
our particles are always rapidly being replaced. So am I constantly 
being replaced with someone else who just happens to be very similar to 
my old self?</p>
<p>I am trying to illustrate why consciousness is not an easy issue. If 
we talk about consciousness as just a certain type of intelligent skill:
 the ability to reflect on oneâs own self and situation, for example, 
then the issue is not difficult at all because any skill or capability 
or form of intelligence that one cares to define will be replicated in 
nonbiological entities (i.e., machines) within a few decades. With this 
type of <em>objective</em> view of consciousness, the conundrums do go 
away. But a fully objective view does not penetrate to the core of the 
issue, because the essence of consciousness is <em>subjective</em> experience, not objective correlates of that experience.</p>
<p>Will these future machines be capable of having spiritual experiences?</p>
<p>They certainly will claim to. They will claim to be people, and to 
have the full range of emotional and spiritual experiences that people 
claim to have. And these will not be idle claims; they will evidence the
 sort of rich, complex, and subtle behavior one associates with these 
feelings. How do the claims and behaviorsâcompelling as they will 
beârelate to the subjective experience of these reinstantiated people? 
We keep coming back to the very real but ultimately unmeasurable issue 
of consciousness.</p>
<p>People often talk about consciousness as if it were a clear property 
of an entity that can readily be identified, detected, and gauged. If 
there is one crucial insight that we can make regarding why the issue of
 consciousness is so contentious, it is the following:</p>
<p>There exists no objective test that can conclusively determine its presence.</p>
<p>Science is about objective measurement and logical implications 
therefrom, but the very nature of objectivity is that you cannot measure
 subjective experience-you can only measure correlates of it, such as 
behavior (and by behavior, I include the actions of components of an 
entity, such as neurons). This limitation has to do with the very nature
 of the concepts âobjectiveâ and âsubjective.â Fundamentally, we cannot 
penetrate the subjective experience of another entity with direct 
objective measurement. We can certainly make arguments about it: i.e., 
âlook inside the brain of this nonhuman entity, see how its methods are 
just like a human brain.â Or, âsee how its behavior is just like human 
behavior.â But in the end, these remain just arguments. No matter how 
convincing the behavior of a reinstantiated person, some observers will 
refuse to accept the consciousness of an entity unless it squirts 
neurotransmitters, or is based on DNA-guided protein synthesis, or has 
some other specific biologically human attribute.</p>
<p>We assume that other humans are conscious, but that is still an 
assumption, and there is no consensus amongst humans about the 
consciousness of nonhuman entities, such as higher non-human animals. 
The issue will be even more contentious with regard to future 
nonbiological entities with human-like behavior and intelligence.</p>
<p>So how will we resolve the claimed consciousness of nonbiological 
intelligence (claimed, that is, by the machines)? From a practical 
perspective, weâll accept their claims. Keep in mind that nonbiological 
entities in the twenty-first century will be extremely intelligent, so 
theyâll be able to convince us that they are conscious. Theyâll have all
 the delicate and emotional cues that convince us today that humans are 
conscious. They will be able to make us laugh and cry. And theyâll get 
mad if we donât accept their claims. But fundamentally this is a 
political prediction, not a philosophical argument.</p>
<h2>On Tubules and Quantum Computing</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, Roger Penrose, a noted physicist and 
philosopher, has suggested that fine structures in the neurons called 
tubules perform an exotic form of computation called âquantum 
computing.â Quantum computing is computing using what are called âqu 
bitsâ which take on all possible combinations of solutions 
simultaneously. It can be considered to be an extreme form of parallel 
processing (because every combination of values of the qu bits are 
tested simultaneously). Penrose suggests that the tubules and their 
quantum computing capabilities complicate the concept of recreating 
neurons and reinstantiating mind files.</p>
<p>However, there is little to suggest that the tubules contribute to 
the thinking process. Even generous models of human knowledge and 
capability are more than accounted for by current estimates of brain 
size, based on contemporary models of neuron functioning that do not 
include tubules. In fact, even with these tubule-less models, it appears
 that the brain is conservatively designed with many more connections 
(by several orders of magnitude) than it needs for its capabilities and 
capacity. Recent experiments (e.g., the San Diego Institute for 
Nonlinear Science experiments) showing that hybrid 
biological-nonbiological networks perform similarly to all biological 
networks, while not definitive, are strongly suggestive that our 
tubule-less models of neuron functioning are adequate. Lloyd Wattsâ 
software simulation of his intricate model of human auditory processing 
uses orders of magnitude less computation than the networks of neurons 
he is simulating, and there is no suggestion that quantum computing is 
needed.</p>
<p>However, even if the tubules are important, it doesnât change the 
projections I have discussed above to any significant degree. According 
to my model of computational growth, if the tubules multiplied neuron 
complexity by a factor of a thousand (and keep in mind that our current 
tubule-less neuron models are already complex, including on the order of
 a thousand connections per neuron, multiple nonlinearities and other 
details), this would delay our reaching brain capacity by only about 9 
years. If weâre off by a factor of a million, thatâs still only a delay 
of 17 years. A factor of a billion is around 24 years (keep in mind 
computation is growing by a double exponential).</p>
<p>With regard to quantum computing, once again there is nothing to 
suggest that the brain does quantum computing. Just because quantum 
technology may be feasible does not suggest that the brain is capable of
 it. After all, we donât have lasers or even radios in our brains. 
Although some scientists have claimed to detect quantum wave collapse in
 the brain, no one has suggested human capabilities that actually 
require a capacity for quantum computing.</p>
<p>However, even if the brain does do quantum computing, this does not 
significantly change the outlook for human-level computing (and beyond) 
nor does it suggest that brain downloading is infeasible. First of all, 
if the brain does do quantum computing this would only verify that 
quantum computing is feasible. There would be nothing in such a finding 
to suggest that quantum computing is restricted to biological 
mechanisms. Biological quantum computing mechanisms, if they exist, 
could be replicated. Indeed, recent experiments with small scale quantum
 computers appear to be successful. Even the conventional transistor 
relies on the quantum effect of electron tunneling.</p>
<p>Penrose suggests that it is impossible to perfectly replicate a set 
of quantum states, so therefore, perfect downloading is impossible. 
Well, how perfect does a download have to be? I am at this moment in a 
very different quantum state (and different in non-quantum ways as well)
 than I was a minute ago (certainly in a very different state than I was
 before I wrote this paragraph). If we develop downloading technology to
 the point where the âcopiesâ are as close to the original as the 
original person changes anyway in the course of one minute, that would 
be good enough for any conceivable purpose, yet does not require copying
 quantum states. As the technology improves, the accuracy of the copy 
could become as close as the original changes within ever briefer 
periods of time (e.g., one second, one millisecond, one microsecond).</p>
<p>When it was pointed out to Penrose that neurons (and even neural 
connections) were too big for quantum computing, he came up with the 
tubule theory as a possible mechanism for neural quantum computing. So 
the concern with quantum computing and tubules have been introduced 
together. If one is searching for barriers to replicating brain 
function, it is an ingenious theory, but it fails to introduce any 
genuine barriers. There is no evidence for it, and even if true, it only
 delays matters by a decade or two. There is no reason to believe that 
biological mechanisms (including quantum computing) are inherently 
impossible to replicate using nonbiological materials and mechanisms. 
Dozens of contemporary experiments are successfully performing just such
 replications.</p>
<h2>The Noninvasive Surgery-Free Reversible Programmable Distributed 
Brain Implant, Full-Immersion Shared Virtual Reality Environments, 
Experience Beamers, and Brain Expansion</h2>
<p>How will we apply technology that is more intelligent than its 
creators? One might be tempted to respond âCarefully!â But letâs take a 
look at some examples.</p>
<p>Consider several examples of the nanobot technology, which, based on 
miniaturization and cost reduction trends, will be feasible within 30 
years. In addition to scanning your brain, the nanobots will also be 
able to expand our experiences and our capabilities.</p>
<p>Nanobot technology will provide fully immersive, totally convincing 
virtual reality in the following way. The nanobots take up positions in 
close physical proximity to every interneuronal connection coming from 
all of our senses (e.g., eyes, ears, skin). We already have the 
technology for electronic devices to communicate with neurons in both 
directions that requires no direct physical contact with the neurons. 
For example, scientists at the Max Planck Institute have developed 
âneuron transistorsâ that can detect the firing of a nearby neuron, or 
alternatively, can cause a nearby neuron to fire, or suppress it from 
firing. This amounts to two-way communication between neurons and the 
electronic-based neuron transistors. The Institute scientists 
demonstrated their invention by controlling the movement of a living 
leech from their computer. Again, the primary aspect of nanobot-based 
virtual reality that is not yet feasible is size and cost.</p>
<p>When we want to experience real reality, the nanobots just stay in 
position (in the capillaries) and do nothing. If we want to enter 
virtual reality, they suppress all of the inputs coming from the real 
senses, and replace them with the signals that would be appropriate for 
the virtual environment. You (i.e., your brain) could decide to cause 
your muscles and limbs to move as you normally would, but the nanobots 
again intercept these interneuronal signals, suppress your real limbs 
from moving, and instead cause your virtual limbs to move and provide 
the appropriate movement and reorientation in the virtual environment.</p>
<p>The web will provide a panoply of virtual environments to explore. 
Some will be recreations of real places, others will be fanciful 
environments that have no ârealâ counterpart. Some indeed would be 
impossible in the physical world (perhaps, because they violate the laws
 of physics). We will be able to âgoâ to these virtual environments by 
ourselves, or we will meet other people there, both real people and 
simulated people. Of course, ultimately there wonât be a clear 
distinction between the two.</p>
<p>By 2030, going to a web site will mean entering a full immersion 
virtual reality environment. In addition to encompassing all of the 
senses, these shared environments can include emotional overlays as the 
nanobots will be capable of triggering the neurological correlates of 
emotions, sexual pleasure, and other derivatives of our sensory 
experience and mental reactions.</p>
<p>In the same way that people today beam their lives from web cams in 
their bedrooms, âexperience beamersâ circa 2030 will beam their entire 
flow of sensory experiences, and if so desired, their emotions and other
 secondary reactions. Weâll be able to plug in (by going to the 
appropriate web site) and experience other peopleâs lives as in the plot
 concept of âBeing John Malkovich.â Particularly interesting experiences
 can be archived and relived at any time.</p>
<p>We wonât need to wait until 2030 to experience shared virtual reality
 environments, at least for the visual and auditory senses. Full 
immersion visual-auditory environments will be available by the end of 
this decade with images written directly onto our retinas by our 
eyeglasses and contact lenses. All of the electronics for the 
computation, image reconstruction, and very high bandwidth wireless 
connection to the Internet will be embedded in our glasses and woven 
into our clothing, so computers as distinct objects will disappear.</p>
<p>In my view, the most significant implication of the Singularity will 
be the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence. First, it is
 important to point out that well before the end of the twenty-first 
century, thinking on nonbiological substrates will dominate. Biological 
thinking is stuck at 10<sup>26</sup> calculations per second (for all 
biological human brains), and that figure will not appreciably change, 
even with bioengineering changes to our genome. Nonbiological 
intelligence, on the other hand, is growing at a double exponential rate
 and will vastly exceed biological intelligence well before the middle 
of this century. However, in my view, this nonbiological intelligence 
should still be considered human as it is fully derivative of the 
human-machine civilization. The merger of these two worlds of 
intelligence is not merely a merger of biological and nonbiological 
thinking mediums, but more importantly one of method and organization of
 thinking.</p>
<p>One of the key ways in which the two worlds can interact will be 
through the nanobots. Nanobot technology will be able to expand our 
minds in virtually any imaginable way. Our brains today are relatively 
fixed in design. Although we do add patterns of interneuronal 
connections and neurotransmitter concentrations as a normal part of the 
learning process, the current overall capacity of the human brain is 
highly constrained, restricted to a mere hundred trillion connections. 
Brain implants based on massively distributed intelligent nanobots will 
ultimately expand our memories a trillion fold, and otherwise vastly 
improve all of our sensory, pattern recognition, and cognitive 
abilities. Since the nanobots are communicating with each other over a 
wireless local area network, they can create any set of new neural 
connections, can break existing connections (by suppressing neural 
firing), can create new hybrid biological-nonbiological networks, as 
well as add vast new nonbiological networks.</p>
<p>Using nanobots as brain extenders is a significant improvement over 
the idea of surgically installed neural implants, which are beginning to
 be used today (e.g., ventral posterior nucleus, subthalmic nucleus, and
 ventral lateral thalamus neural implants to counteract Parkinsonâs 
Disease and tremors from other neurological disorders, cochlear 
implants, and others.) Nanobots will be introduced without surgery, 
essentially just by injecting or even swallowing them. They can all be 
directed to leave, so the process is easily reversible. They are 
programmable, in that they can provide virtual reality one minute, and a
 variety of brain extensions the next. They can change their 
configuration, and clearly can alter their software. Perhaps most 
importantly, they are massively distributed and therefore can take up 
billions or trillions of positions throughout the brain, whereas a 
surgically introduced neural implant can only be placed in one or at 
most a few locations.</p>
<h2>The Double Exponential Growth of the Economy During the 1990s Was Not a Bubble</h2>
<p>Yet another manifestation of the law of accelerating returns as it 
rushes toward the Singularity can be found in the world of economics, a 
world vital to both the genesis of the law of accelerating returns, and 
to its implications. It is the economic imperative of a competitive 
marketplace that is driving technology forward and fueling the law of 
accelerating returns. In turn, the law of accelerating returns, 
particularly as it approaches the Singularity, is transforming economic 
relationships.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the economic models taught in economics classes, 
used by the Federal Reserve Board to set monetary policy, by Government 
agencies to set economic policy, and by economic forecasters of all 
kinds are fundamentally flawed because they are based on the intuitive 
linear view of history rather than the historically based exponential 
view. The reason that these linear models appear to work for a while is 
for the same reason that most people adopt the intuitive linear view in 
the first place: exponential trends appear to be linear when viewed (and
 experienced) for a brief period of time, particularly in the early 
stages of an exponential trend when not much is happening. But once the 
âknee of the curveâ is achieved and the exponential growth explodes, the
 linear models break down. The exponential trends underlying 
productivity growth are just beginning this explosive phase.</p>
<p>The economy (viewed either in total or per capita) has been growing exponentially throughout this century:<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart24.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p><img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart25.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>There is also a second level of exponential growth, but up until 
recently the second exponent has been in the early phase so that the 
growth in the growth rate has not been noticed. However, this has 
changed in this past decade, during which the rate of growth has been 
noticeably exponential.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart26.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>Productivity (economic output per worker) has also been growing 
exponentially. Even these statistics are greatly understated because 
they do not fully reflect significant improvements in the quality and 
features of products and services. It is not the case that âa car is a 
car;â there have been significant improvements in safety, reliability, 
and features. There are a myriad of such examples. Pharmaceutical drugs 
are increasingly effective. Groceries ordered in five minutes on the web
 and delivered to your door are worth more than groceries on a 
supermarket shelf that you have to fetch yourself. Clothes custom 
manufactured for your unique body scan are worth more than clothes you 
happen to find left on a store rack. These sorts of improvements are 
true for most product categories, and none of them are reflected in the 
productivity statistics.</p>
<p>The statistical methods underlying the productivity measurements tend
 to factor out gains by essentially concluding that we still only get 
one dollar of products and services for a dollar despite the fact that 
we get much more for a dollar (e.g., compare a $1,000 computer today to 
one ten years ago). University of Chicago Professor Pete Klenow and 
University of Rochester Professor Mark Bils estimate that the value of 
existing goods has been increasing at 1.5% per year for the past 20 
years because of qualitative improvements. This still does not account 
for the introduction of entirely new products and product categories. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is responsible for the inflation 
statistics, uses a model that incorporates an estimate of quality growth
 at only 0.5% per year, reflecting a systematic underestimate of quality
 improvement and a resulting overestimate of inflation by at least 1 
percent per year.</p>
<p>Despite these weaknesses in the productivity statistical methods, the
 gains in productivity are now reaching the steep part of the 
exponential curve. Labor productivity grew at 1.6% per year until 1994, 
then rose at 2.4% per year, and is now growing even more rapidly. In the
 quarter ending July 30, 2000, labor productivity grew at 5.3%. 
Manufacturing productivity grew at 4.4% annually from 1995 to 1999, 
durables manufacturing at 6.5% per year.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart27.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>The 1990s have seen the most powerful deflationary forces in history.
 This is why we are not seeing inflation. Yes, itâs true that low 
unemployment, high asset values, economic growth, and other such factors
 are inflationary, but these factors are offset by the double 
exponential trends in the price-performance of all information based 
technologies: computation, memory, communications, biotechnology, 
miniaturization, and even the overall rate of technical progress. These 
technologies deeply affect all industries.</p>
<p>We are also undergoing massive disintermediation in the channels of 
distribution through the web and other new communication technologies, 
as well as escalating efficiencies in operations and administration.</p>
<p>All of the technology trend charts in this essay e represent massive 
deflation. There are many examples of the impact of these escalating 
efficiencies. BP Amocoâs cost for finding oil is now less than $1 per 
barrel, down from nearly $10 in 1991. Processing an internet transaction
 costs a bank one penny, compared to over $1 using a teller ten years 
ago. A Roland Berger / Deutsche Bank study estimates a cost savings of 
$1200 per North American car over the next five years. A more optimistic
 Morgan Stanley study estimates that Internet-based procurement will 
save Ford, GM, and DaimlerChrysler about $2700 per vehicle. Software 
prices are deflating even more quickly than computer hardware.</p>

<p>Current economic policy is based on outdated models which include 
energy prices, commodity prices, and capital investment in plant and 
equipment as key driving factors, but do not adequately model bandwidth,
 MIPs, megabytes, intellectual property, knowledge, and other 
increasingly vital (and increasingly increasing) constituents that are 
driving the economy.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart29.jpg" alt="" vspace="10"></p>
<p>The economy âwantsâ to grow more than the 3.5% per year, which 
constitutes the current âspeed limitâ that the Federal Reserve bank and 
other policy makers have established as âsafe,â meaning noninflationary.
 But in keeping with the law of accelerating returns, the economy is 
capable of âsafelyâ establishing this level of growth in less than a 
year, implying a growth rate in an entire year of greater than 3.5%. 
Recently, the growth rate has exceeded 5%.</p>
<p>None of this means that cycles of recession will disappear 
immediately. The economy still has some of the underlying dynamics that 
historically have caused cycles of recession, specifically excessive 
commitments such as capital intensive projects and the overstocking of 
inventories. However, the rapid dissemination of information, 
sophisticated forms of online procurement, and increasingly transparent 
markets in all industries have diminished the impact of this cycle. So 
ârecessionsâ are likely to be shallow and short lived. The underlying 
long-term growth rate will continue at a double exponential rate.</p>
<p>The overall growth of the economy reflects completely new forms and 
layers of wealth and value that did not previously exist, or least that 
did not previously constitute a significant portion of the economy (but 
do now): intellectual property, communication portals, web sites, 
bandwidth, software, data bases, and many other new technology based 
categories.</p>
<p>There is no need for high interest rates to counter an inflation that
 doesnât exist. The inflationary pressures which exist are 
counterbalanced by all of the deflationary forces Iâve mentioned. The 
current high interest rates fostered by the Federal Reserve Bank are 
destructive, are causing trillions of dollars of lost wealth, are 
regressive, hurt business and the middle class, and are completely 
unnecessary.</p>
<p>The Fedâs monetary policy is only influential because people believe 
it to be. It has little real power. The economy today is largely backed 
by private capital in the form of a growing variety of equity 
instruments. The portion of available liquidity in the economy that the 
Fed actually controls is relatively insignificant. The reserves that 
banks and financial institutions maintain with the Federal Reserve 
System are less than $50 billion, which is only 0.6% of the GDP, and 
0.25% of the liquidity available in stocks.</p>
<p>Restricting the growth rate of the economy to an arbitrary limit 
makes as much sense as restricting the rate at which a company can grow 
its revenuesâor its market cap. Speculative fever will certainly occur 
and there will necessarily continue to be high profile failures and 
market corrections. However the ability of technology companies to 
rapidly create newârealâwealth is just one of the factors that will 
continue to fuel ongoing double exponential growth in the economy. These
 policies have led to an âAlice in Wonderlandâ situation in which the 
market goes up on bad economic news (because it means that more 
unnecessary punishment will be avoided) and goes down on good economic 
news.</p>
<p>Speaking of market speculative fever and market corrections, the 
stock market values for so-called âB to Bâ (Business to Business) and âB
 to Câ (Business to Consumer) web portals and enabling technologies is 
likely to come back strongly as it becomes clear that economic 
transactions are indeed escalating toward e-commerce, and that the 
(surviving) contenders are capable of demonstrating profitable business 
models.</p>
<p>The intuitive linear assumption underlying economic thinking reaches 
its most ludicrous conclusions in the political debate surrounding the 
long-term future of the social security system. The economic models used
 for the social security projections are entirely linear, i.e., they 
reflect fixed economic growth. This might be viewed as conservative 
planning if we were talking about projections of only a few years, but 
they become utterly unrealistic for the three to four decades being 
discussed. These projections actually assume a fixed rate of growth of 
3.5% per year for the next fifty years! There are incredibly naÃ¯ve 
assumptions that bear on both sides of the argument. On the one hand, 
there will be radical extensions to human longevity, while on the other 
hand, we will benefit from far greater economic expansion. These factors
 do not rule each other out, however, as the positive factors are 
stronger, and will ultimately dominate. Moreover, we are certain to 
rethink social security when we have centenarians who look and act like 
30 year-olds (but who will think much faster than 30 year-olds circa the
 year 2000).</p>
<p>Another implication of the law of accelerating returns is exponential
 growth in education and learning. Over the past 120 years, we have 
increased our investment in K-12 education (per student and in constant 
dollars) by a factor of ten. We have a one hundred fold increase in the 
number of college students. Automation started by amplifying the power 
of our muscles, and in recent times has been amplifying the power of our
 minds. Thus, for the past two centuries, automation has been 
eliminating jobs at the bottom of the skill ladder while creating new 
(and better paying) jobs at the top of the skill ladder. So the ladder 
has been moving up, and thus we have been exponentially increasing 
investments in education at all levels.<br>

<p>Oh, and about that âofferâ at the beginning of this essay, consider 
that present stock values are based on future expectations. Given that 
the (literally) short sighted linear intuitive view represents the 
ubiquitous outlook, the common wisdom in economic expectations are 
dramatically understated. Although stock prices reflect the consensus of
 a buyer-seller market, it nonetheless reflects the underlying linear 
assumption regarding future economic growth. But the law of accelerating
 returns clearly implies that the growth rate will continue to grow 
exponentially because the rate of progress will continue to accelerate. 
Although (weakening) recessionary cycles will continue to cause 
immediate growth rates to fluctuate, the underlying rate of growth will 
continue to double approximately every decade.</p>
<p>But wait a second, you said that I would get $40 trillion if I read and understood this essay.</p>
<p>Thatâs right. According to my models, if we replace the linear 
outlook with the more appropriate exponential outlook, current stock 
prices should triple. Since thereâs about $20 trillion in the equity 
markets, thatâs $40 trillion in additional wealth.</p>
<p>But you said I would get that money.</p>
<p>No, I said âyouâ would get the money, and thatâs why I suggested 
reading the sentence carefully. The English word âyouâ can be singular 
or plural. I meant it in the sense of âall of you.â</p>
<p>I see, all of us as in the whole world. But not everyone will read this essay.</p>
<p>Well, but everyone could. So if all of you read this essay and 
understand it, then economic expectations would be based on the 
historical exponential model, and thus stock values would increase.</p>
<p>You mean if everyone understands it, and agrees with it.</p>
<p>Okay, I suppose I was assuming that.</p>
<p>Is that what you expect to happen.</p>
<p>Well, actually, no. Putting on my futurist hat again, my prediction 
is that indeed these views will prevail, but only over time, as more and
 more evidence of the exponential nature of technology and its impact on
 the economy becomes apparent. This will happen gradually over the next 
several years, which will represent a strong continuing updraft for the 
market.</p>
<h2>A Clear and Future Danger</h2>
<p>Technology has always been a double edged sword, bringing us longer 
and healthier life spans, freedom from physical and mental drudgery, and
 many new creative possibilities on the one hand, while introducing new 
and salient dangers on the other. We still live today with sufficient 
nuclear weapons (not all of which appear to be well accounted for) to 
end all mammalian life on the planet. Bioengineering is in the early 
stages of enormous strides in reversing disease and aging processes. 
However, the means and knowledge will soon exist in a routine college 
bioengineering lab (and already exists in more sophisticated labs) to 
create unfriendly pathogens more dangerous than nuclear weapons. As 
technology accelerates toward the Singularity, we will see the same 
intertwined potentials: a feast of creativity resulting from human 
intelligence expanded a trillion-fold combined with many grave new 
dangers.</p>
<p>Consider unrestrained nanobot replication. Nanobot technology 
requires billions or trillions of such intelligent devices to be useful.
 The most cost effective way to scale up to such levels is through 
self-replication, essentially the same approach used in the biological 
world. And in the same way that biological self-replication gone awry 
(i.e., cancer) results in biological destruction, a defect in the 
mechanism curtailing nanobot self-replication would endanger all 
physical entities, biological or otherwise.</p>
<p>Other primary concerns include âwho is controlling the nanobots?â and
 âwho are the nanobots talking to?â Organizations (e.g., governments, 
extremist groups) or just a clever individual could put trillions of 
undetectable nanobots in the water or food supply of an individual or of
 an entire population. These âspyâ nanobots could then monitor, 
influence, and even control our thoughts and actions. In addition to 
introducing physical spy nanobots, existing nanobots could be influenced
 through software viruses and other software âhackingâ techniques. When 
there is software running in our brains, issues of privacy and security 
will take on a new urgency.</p>
<p>My own expectation is that the creative and constructive applications
 of this technology will dominate, as I believe they do today. But there
 will be a valuable (and increasingly vocal) role for a concerned and 
constructive Luddite movement (i.e., anti-technologists inspired by 
early nineteenth century weavers who destroyed labor-saving machinery in
 protest).</p>
<p>If we imagine describing the dangers that exist today to people who 
lived a couple of hundred years ago, they would think it mad to take 
such risks. On the other hand, how many people in the year 2000 would 
really want to go back to the short, brutish, disease-filled, 
poverty-stricken, disaster-prone lives that 99 percent of the human race
 struggled through a couple of centuries ago? We may romanticize the 
past, but up until fairly recently, most of humanity lived extremely 
fragile lives where one all too common misfortune could spell disaster. 
Substantial portions of our species still live in this precarious way, 
which is at least one reason to continue technological progress and the 
economic enhancement that accompanies it.</p>
<p>People often go through three stages in examining the impact of 
future technology: awe and wonderment at its potential to overcome age 
old problems, then a sense of dread at a new set of grave dangers that 
accompany these new technologies, followed, finally and hopefully, by 
the realization that the only viable and responsible path is to set a 
careful course that can realize the promise while managing the peril.</p>
<p>In his cover story for WIRED <em>Why The Future Doesnât Need</em> Us,
 Bill Joy eloquently described the plagues of centuriesâ past, and how 
new self-replicating technologies, such as mutant bioengineered 
pathogens, and ânanobotsâ run amok, may bring back long forgotten 
pestilence. Indeed these are real dangers. It is also the case, which 
Joy acknowledges, that it has been technological advances, such as 
antibiotics and improved sanitation, which has freed us from the 
prevalence of such plagues. Suffering in the world continues and demands
 our steadfast attention. Should we tell the millions of people 
afflicted with cancer and other devastating conditions that we are 
canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments because there 
is a risk that these same technologies may someday be used for 
malevolent purposes? Having asked the rhetorical question, I realize 
that there is a movement to do exactly that, but I think most people 
would agree that such broad based relinquishment is not the answer.</p>
<p>The continued opportunity to alleviate human distress is one 
important motivation for continuing technological advancement. Also 
compelling are the already apparent economic gains I discussed above 
which will continue to hasten in the decades ahead. The continued 
acceleration of many intertwined technologies are roads paved with gold 
(I use the plural here because technology is clearly not a single path).
 In a competitive environment, it is an economic imperative to go down 
these roads. Relinquishing technological advancement would be economic 
suicide for individuals, companies, and nations.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the issue of relinquishment, which is Bill Joyâs 
most controversial recommendation and personal commitment. I do feel 
that relinquishment at the right level is part of a responsible and 
constructive response to these genuine perils. The issue, however, is 
exactly this: at what level are we to relinquish technology?</p>
<p>Ted Kaczynski would have us renounce all of it. This, in my view, is 
neither desirable nor feasible, and the futility of such a position is 
only underscored by the senselessness of Kaczynskiâs deplorable tactics.</p>
<p>Another level would be to forego certain fields; nanotechnology, for 
example, that might be regarded as too dangerous. But such sweeping 
strokes of relinquishment are equally untenable. Nanotechnology is 
simply the inevitable end result of the persistent trend toward 
miniaturization which pervades all of technology. It is far from a 
single centralized effort, but is being pursued by a myriad of projects 
with many diverse goals.</p>
<p>One observer wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>âA further reason why industrial society cannot be 
reformed. . . is that modern technology is a unified system in which all
 parts are dependent on one another. You canât get rid of the âbadâ 
parts of technology and retain only the âgoodâ parts. Take modern 
medicine, for example. Progress in medical science depends on progress 
in chemistry, physics, biology, computer science and other fields. 
Advanced medical treatments require expensive, high-tech equipment that 
can be made available only by a technologically progressive, 
economically rich society. Clearly you canât have much progress in 
medicine without the whole technological system and everything that goes
 with it.â</p></blockquote>
<p>The observer I am quoting is, again, Ted Kaczynski. Although one 
might properly resist Kaczynski as an authority, I believe he is correct
 on the deeply entangled nature of the benefits and risks. However, 
Kaczynski and I clearly part company on our overall assessment on the 
relative balance between the two. Bill Joy and I have dialogued on this 
issue both publicly and privately, and we both believe that technology 
will and should progress, and that we need to be actively concerned with
 the dark side. If Bill and I disagree, itâs on the granularity of 
relinquishment that is both feasible and desirable.</p>
<p>Abandonment of broad areas of technology will only push them 
underground where development would continue unimpeded by ethics and 
regulation. In such a situation, it would be the less stable, less 
responsible practitioners (e.g., the terrorists) who would have all the 
expertise.</p>
<p>I do think that relinquishment at the right level needs to be part of
 our ethical response to the dangers of twenty first century 
technologies. One constructive example of this is the proposed ethical 
guideline by the Foresight Institute, founded by nanotechnology pioneer 
Eric Drexler, that nanotechnologists agree to relinquish the development
 of physical entities that can self-replicate in a natural environment. 
Another is a ban on self-replicating physical entities that contain 
their own codes for self-replication. In what nanotechnologist Ralph 
Merkle calls the âBroadcast Architecture,â such entities would have to 
obtain such codes from a centralized secure server, which would guard 
against undesirable replication. The Broadcast Architecture is 
impossible in the biological world, which represents at least one way in
 which nanotechnology can be made safer than biotechnology. In other 
ways, nanotech is potentially more dangerous because nanobots can be 
physically stronger than protein-based entities and more intelligent. It
 will eventually be possible to combine the two by having nanotechnology
 provide the codes within biological entities (replacing DNA), in which 
case biological entities can use the much safer Broadcast Architecture.</p>
<p>Our ethics as responsible technologists should include such âfine 
grainedâ relinquishment, among other professional ethical guidelines. 
Other protections will need to include oversight by regulatory bodies, 
the development of technology-specific âimmuneâ responses, as well as 
computer assisted surveillance by law enforcement organizations. Many 
people are not aware that our intelligence agencies already use advanced
 technologies such as automated word spotting to monitor a substantial 
flow of telephone conversations. As we go forward, balancing our 
cherished rights of privacy with our need to be protected from the 
malicious use of powerful twenty first century technologies will be one 
of many profound challenges. This is one reason that such issues as an 
encryption âtrap doorâ (in which law enforcement authorities would have 
access to otherwise secure information) and the FBI âCarnivoreâ 
email-snooping system have been so contentious.</p>
<p>As a test case, we can take a small measure of comfort from how we 
have dealt with one recent technological challenge. There exists today a
 new form of fully nonbiological self replicating entity that didnât 
exist just a few decades ago: the computer virus. When this form of 
destructive intruder first appeared, strong concerns were voiced that as
 they became more sophisticated, software pathogens had the potential to
 destroy the computer network medium they live in. Yet the âimmune 
systemâ that has evolved in response to this challenge has been largely 
effective. Although destructive self-replicating software entities do 
cause damage from time to time, the injury is but a small fraction of 
the benefit we receive from the computers and communication links that 
harbor them. No one would suggest we do away with computers, local area 
networks, and the Internet because of software viruses.</p>
<p>One might counter that computer viruses do not have the lethal 
potential of biological viruses or of destructive nanotechnology. 
Although true, this strengthens my observation. The fact that computer 
viruses are not usually deadly to humans only means that more people are
 willing to create and release them. It also means that our response to 
the danger is that much less intense. Conversely, when it comes to self 
replicating entities that are potentially lethal on a large scale, our 
response on all levels will be vastly more serious.</p>
<p>Technology will remain a double edged sword, and the story of the 
Twenty First century has not yet been written. It represents vast power 
to be used for all humankindâs purposes. We have no choice but to work 
hard to apply these quickening technologies to advance our human values,
 despite what often appears to be a lack of consensus on what those 
values should be.</p>
<h2>Living Forever</h2>
<p>Once brain porting technology has been refined and fully developed, 
will this enable us to live forever? The answer depends on what we mean 
by living and dying. Consider what we do today with our personal 
computer files. When we change from one personal computer to a less 
obsolete model, we donât throw all our files away; rather we copy them 
over to the new hardware. Although our software files do not necessary 
continue their existence forever, the longevity of our personal computer
 software is completely separate and disconnected from the hardware that
 it runs on. When it comes to our personal mind file, however, when our 
human hardware crashes, the software of our lives dies with it. However,
 this will not continue to be the case when we have the means to store 
and restore the thousands of trillions of bytes of information 
represented in the pattern that we call our brains.</p>
<p>The longevity of oneâs mind file will not be dependent, therefore, on
 the continued viability of any particular hardware medium. Ultimately 
software-based humans, albeit vastly extended beyond the severe 
limitations of humans as we know them today, will live out on the web, 
projecting bodies whenever they need or want them, including virtual 
bodies in diverse realms of virtual reality, holographically projected 
bodies, physical bodies comprised of nanobot swarms, and other forms of 
nanotechnology.</p>
<p>A software-based human will be free, therefore, from the constraints 
of any particular thinking medium. Today, we are each confined to a mere
 hundred trillion connections, but humans at the end of the twenty-first
 century can grow their thinking and thoughts without limit. We may 
regard this as a form of immortality, although it is worth pointing out 
that data and information do not necessarily last forever. Although not 
dependent on the viability of the hardware it runs on, the longevity of 
information depends on its relevance, utility, and accessibility. If 
youâve ever tried to retrieve information from an obsolete form of data 
storage in an old obscure format (e.g., a reel of magnetic tape from a 
1970 minicomputer), you will understand the challenges in keeping 
software viable. However, if we are diligent in maintaining our mind 
file, keeping current backups, and porting to current formats and 
mediums, then a form of immortality can be attained, at least for 
software-based humans. Our mind fileâour personality, skills, 
memoriesâall of that is lost today when our biological hardware crashes.
 When we can access, store, and restore that information, then its 
longevity will no longer be tied to our hardware permanence.</p>
<p>Is this form of immortality the same concept as a physical human, as 
we know them today, living forever? In one sense it is, because as I 
pointed out earlier, our contemporary selves are not a constant 
collection of matter either. Only our pattern of matter and energy 
persists, and even that gradually changes. Similarly, it will be the 
pattern of a software human that persists and develops and changes 
gradually.</p>
<p>But is that person based on my mind file, who migrates across many 
computational substrates, and who outlives any particular thinking 
medium, really me? We come back to the same questions of consciousness 
and identity, issues that have been debated since the Platonic 
dialogues. As we go through the twenty-first century, these will not 
remain polite philosophical debates, but will be confronted as vital, 
practical, political, and legal issues.</p>
<p>A related question is âis death desirable?â A great deal of our 
effort goes into avoiding it. We make extraordinary efforts to delay it,
 and indeed often consider its intrusion a tragic event. Yet we might 
find it hard to live without it. We consider death as giving meaning to 
our lives. It gives importance and value to time. Time could become 
meaningless if there were too much of it.</p>
<h2>The Next Step in Evolution and the Purpose of Life</h2>
<p>But I regard the freeing of the human mind from its severe physical 
limitations of scope and duration as the necessary next step in 
evolution. Evolution, in my view, represents the purpose of life. That 
is, the purpose of lifeâand of our livesâis to evolve. The Singularity 
then is not a grave danger to be avoided. In my view, this next paradigm
 shift represents the goal of our civilization.</p>
<p>What does it mean to evolve? Evolution moves toward greater 
complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, 
greater beauty, greater creativity, and more of other abstract and 
subtle attributes such as love. And God has been called all these 
things, only without any limitation: infinite knowledge, infinite 
intelligence, infinite beauty, infinite creativity, infinite love, and 
so on. Of course, even the accelerating growth of evolution never 
achieves an infinite level, but as it explodes exponentially, it 
certainly moves rapidly in that direction. So evolution moves inexorably
 toward our conception of God, albeit never quite reaching this ideal. 
Thus the freeing of our thinking from the severe limitations of its 
biological form may be regarded as an essential spiritual quest.</p>
<p>In making this statement, it is important to emphasize that terms 
like evolution, destiny, and spiritual quest are observations about the 
end result, not the basis for these predictions. I am not saying that 
technology will evolve to human levels and beyond simply because it is 
our destiny and because of the satisfaction of a spiritual quest. Rather
 my projections result from a methodology based on the dynamics 
underlying the (double) exponential growth of technological processes. 
The primary force driving technology is economic imperative. We are 
moving toward machines with human level intelligence (and beyond) as the
 result of millions of small advances, each with their own particular 
economic justification.</p>
<p>To use an example from my own experience at one of my companies 
(Kurzweil Applied Intelligence), whenever we came up with a slightly 
more intelligent version of speech recognition, the new version 
invariably had greater value than the earlier generation and, as a 
result, sales increased. It is interesting to note that in the example 
of speech recognition software, the three primary surviving competitors 
stayed very close to each other in the intelligence of their software. A
 few other companies that failed to do so (e.g., Speech Systems) went 
out of business. At any point in time, we would be able to sell the 
version prior to the latest version for perhaps a quarter of the price 
of the current version. As for versions of our technology that were two 
generations old, we couldnât even give those away. This phenomenon is 
not only true for pattern recognition and other âAIâ software, but 
applies to all products, from bread makers to cars. And if the product 
itself doesnât exhibit some level of intelligence, then intelligence in 
the manufacturing and marketing methods have a major effect on the 
success and profitability of an enterprise.</p>
<p>There is a vital economic imperative to create more intelligent 
technology. Intelligent machines have enormous value. That is why they 
are being built. There are tens of thousands of projects that are 
advancing intelligent machines in diverse incremental ways. The support 
for âhigh techâ in the business community (mostly software) has grown 
enormously. When I started my optical character recognition (OCR) and 
speech synthesis company (Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.) in 1974, 
there were only a half-dozen high technology IPOâs that year. The number
 of such deals has increased one hundred fold and the number of dollars 
invested has increased by more than one thousand fold in the past 25 
years. In the four years between 1995 and 1999 alone, high tech venture 
capital deals increased from just over $1 billion to approximately $15 
billion.</p>
<p>We will continue to build more powerful computational mechanisms 
because it creates enormous value. We will reverse-engineer the human 
brain not simply because it is our destiny, but because there is 
valuable information to be found there that will provide insights in 
building more intelligent (and more valuable) machines. We would have to
 repeal capitalism and every visage of economic competition to stop this
 progression.</p>
<p>By the second half of this next century, there will be no clear 
distinction between human and machine intelligence. On the one hand, we 
will have biological brains vastly expanded through distributed 
nanobot-based implants. On the other hand, we will have fully 
nonbiological brains that are copies of human brains, albeit also vastly
 extended. And we will have a myriad of other varieties of intimate 
connection between human thinking and the technology it has fostered.</p>
<p>Ultimately, nonbiological intelligence will dominate because it is 
growing at a double exponential rate, whereas for all practical purposes
 biological intelligence is at a standstill. Human thinking is stuck at 
10<sup>26</sup> calculations per second (for all biological humans), and
 that figure will never appreciably change (except for a small increase 
resulting from genetic engineering). Nonbiological thinking is still 
millions of times less today, but the cross over will occur before 2030.
 By the end of the twenty-first century, nonbiological thinking will be 
trillions of trillions of times more powerful than that of its 
biological progenitors, although still of human origin. It will continue
 to be the human-machine civilization taking the next step in evolution.</p>
<p>Most forecasts of the future seem to ignore the revolutionary impact 
of the Singularity in our human destiny: the inevitable emergence of 
computers that match and ultimately vastly exceed the capabilities of 
the human brain, a development that will be no less important than the 
evolution of human intelligence itself some thousands of centuries ago. 
And the primary reason for this failure is that they are based on the 
intuitive but short sighted linear view of history.</p>
<p>Before the next century is over, the Earthâs technology-creating 
species will merge with its computational technology. There will not be a
 clear distinction between human and machine. After all, what is the 
difference between a human brain enhanced a trillion fold by 
nanobot-based implants, and a computer whose design is based on high 
resolution scans of the human brain, and then extended a trillion-fold?</p>
<h2>Why SETI Will Fail (and why we are alone in the Universe)</h2>
<p>The law of accelerating returns implies that by 2099, the 
intelligence that will have emerged from human-machine civilization will
 be trillions of trillions of times more powerful than it is today, 
dominated of course by its nonbiological form.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with SETI (the Search for Extra 
Terrestrial Intelligence)? The naÃ¯ve view, going back to pre-Copernican 
days, was that the Earth was at the center of the Universe, and human 
intelligence its greatest gift (next to God). The more informed recent 
view is that even if the likelihood of a star having a planet with a 
technology creating species is very low (e.g., one in a million), there 
are so many stars (i.e., billions of trillions of them), that there are 
bound to be many with advanced technology.</p>
<p>This is the view behind SETI, was my view until recently, and is the 
common informed view today. Although SETI has not yet looked everywhere,
 it has already covered a substantial portion of the Universe.<br>
<img src="The%20Law%20of%20Accelerating%20Returns%20%7C%20KurzweilAI_files/chart32.gif" alt="" vspace="10"><br>
<span class="PhotoCredit">Chart by Scientific American</span></p>
<p>In the above diagram (courtesy of Scientific American), we can see 
that SETI has already thoroughly searched all star systems within 10<sup>7</sup> light-years from Earth for alien civilizations capable (and willing) to transmit at a power of at least 10<sup>25</sup> watts, a so-called Type II civilization (and all star systems within 10<sup>6</sup> light-years for transmission of at least 10<sup>18</sup> watts, and so on). No sign of intelligence has been found as of yet.</p>
<p>In a recent email to my research assistant, Dr. Seth Shostak of the 
SETI Institute points out that a new comprehensive targeted search, 
called Project Phoenix, which has up to 100 times the sensitivity and 
covers a greater range of the radio dial as compared to previous 
searches, has only been applied thus far to 500 star systems, which is, 
of course only a minute fraction of the half trillion star systems in 
just our own galaxy.</p>
<p>However, according to my model, once a civilization achieves our own 
level (âEarth-levelâ) of radio transmission, it takes no more than one 
century, two at the most, to achieve what SETI calls a Type II 
civilization. If the assumption that there are at least millions of 
radio capable civilizations out there, and that these civilizations are 
spread out over millions (indeed billions) of years of development, then
 surely there ought to be millions that have achieved Type II status.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is not an argument against the SETI project, which
 in my view should have the highest possible priority because the 
negative finding is no less significant than a positive result.</p>
<p>It is odd that we find the cosmos so silent. Where is everybody? 
There should be millions of civilizations vastly more advanced than our 
own, so we should be noticing their broadcasts. A sufficiently advanced 
civilization would not be likely to restrict its broadcasts to subtle 
signals on obscure frequencies. Why are they so silent, and so shy?</p>
<p>As I have studied the implications of the law of accelerating returns, I have come to a different view.</p>
<p>Because exponential growth is so explosive, it is the case that once a
 species develops computing technology, it is only a matter of a couple 
of centuries before the nonbiological form of their intelligence 
explodes. It permeates virtually all matter in their vicinity, and then 
inevitably expands outward close to the maximum speed that information 
can travel. Once the nonbiological intelligence emerging from that 
speciesâ technology has saturated its vicinity (and the nature of this 
saturation is another complex issue, which I wonât deal with in this 
essay), it has no other way to continue to evolve but to expand 
outwardly. The expansion does not start out at the maximum speed, but 
quickly achieves a speed within a vanishingly small delta from the 
maximum speed.</p>
<p>What is the maximum speed? We currently understand this to be the 
speed of light, but there are already tantalizing hints that this may 
not be an absolute limit. There were recent experiments that measured 
the flight time of photons at nearly twice the speed of light, a result 
of quantum uncertainty on their position. However, this result is 
actually not useful for this analysis, because it does not actually 
allow information to be communicated at faster than the speed of light, 
and we are fundamentally interested in communication speed.</p>
<p>Quantum disentanglement has been measured at many times the speed of 
light, but this is only communicating randomness (profound quantum 
randomness) at speeds far greater than the speed of light; again, this 
is not communication of information (but is of great interest for 
restoring encryption, after quantum computing destroys it). There is the
 potential for worm holes (or folds of the Universe in dimensions beyond
 the three visible ones), but this is not really traveling at faster 
than the speed of light, it just means that the topology of the Universe
 is not the simple three dimensional space that naÃ¯ve physics implies. 
But we already knew that. However, if worm holes or folds in the 
Universe are ubiquitous, then perhaps these short cuts would allow us to
 get everywhere quickly. Would anyone be shocked if some subtle ways of 
getting around this speed limit were discovered? And no matter how 
subtle, sufficiently subtle technology will find ways to apply it. The 
point is that if there are ways around this limit (or any other 
currently understood limit), then the extraordinary levels of 
intelligence that our human-machine civilization will achieve will find 
those ways and exploit them.</p>
<p>So for now, we can say that ultra high levels of intelligence will 
expand outward at the speed of light, but recognize that this may not be
 the actual limit of the speed of expansion, or even if the limit is the
 speed of light that this limit may not restrict reaching other 
locations quickly.</p>
<p>Consider that the time spans for biological evolution are measured in
 millions and billions of years, so if there are other civilizations out
 there, they would be spread out by huge spans of time. If there are a 
lot of them, as contemporary thinking implies, then it would be very 
unlikely that at least some of them would not be ahead of us. That at 
least is the SETI assumption. And if they are ahead of us, they likely 
would be ahead of us by huge spans of time. The likelihood that any 
civilization that is ahead of us is ahead of us by only a few decades is
 extremely small.</p>
<p>If the SETI assumption that there are many (e.g., millions) of 
technological (at least radio capable) civilizations is correct, then at
 least some of them (i.e., millions of them) would be way ahead of us. 
But it takes only a few centuries at most from the advent of computation
 for that civilization to expand outward at at least light speed. Given 
this, how can it be that we have not noticed them?</p>
<p>The conclusion I reach is that it is likely that there are no such 
other civilizations. In other words, we are in the lead. Thatâs right, 
our humble civilization with its Dodge pick up trucks, fried chicken 
fast food, and ethnic cleansings (and computation!) is in the lead.</p>
<p>Now how can that be? Isnât this extremely unlikely given the billions
 of trillions of likely planets? Indeed it is very unlikely. But equally
 unlikely is the existence of our Universe with a set of laws of physics
 so exquisitely precisely what is needed for the evolution of life to be
 possible. But by the Anthropic principle, if the Universe didnât allow 
the evolution of life we wouldnât be here to notice it. Yet here we are.
 So by the same Anthropic principle, weâre here in the lead in the 
Universe. Again, if we werenât here, we would not be noticing it.</p>
<p>Letâs consider some arguments against this perspective.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are extremely advanced technological civilizations out 
there, but we are outside their light sphere of intelligence. That is, 
they havenât gotten here yet. Okay, in this case, SETI will still fail 
because we wonât be able to see (or hear) them, at least not before we 
reach Singularity.</p>
<p>Perhaps they are amongst us, but have decided to remain invisible to 
us. Incidentally, I have always considered the science fiction notion of
 large space ships with large squishy creatures similar to us to be very
 unlikely. Any civilization sophisticated enough to make the trip here 
would have long since passed the point of merging with their technology 
and would not need to send such physically bulky organisms and 
equipment. Such a civilization would not have any unmet material needs 
that require it to steal physical resources from us. They would be here 
for observation only, to gather knowledge, which is the only resource of
 value to such a civilization. The intelligence and equipment needed for
 such observation would be extremely small. In this case, SETI will 
still fail because if this civilization decided that it did not want us 
to notice it, then it would succeed in that desire. Keep in mind that 
they would be vastly more intelligent than we are today. Perhaps they 
will reveal themselves to us when we achieve the next level of our 
evolution, specifically merging our biological brains with our 
technology, which is to say, after the Singularity. Moreover, given that
 the SETI assumption implies that there are millions of such highly 
developed civilizations, it seems odd that all of them have made the 
same decision to stay out of our way.</p>
<h2>Why Intelligence is More Powerful than Physics</h2>
<p>As intelligence saturates the matter and energy available to it, it 
turns dumb matter into smart matter. Although smart matter still 
nominally follows the laws of physics, it is so exquisitely intelligent 
that it can harness the most subtle aspects of the laws to manipulate 
matter and energy to its will. So it would at least appear that 
intelligence is more powerful than physics.</p>
<p>Perhaps what I should say is that intelligence is more powerful than 
cosmology. That is, once matter evolves into smart matter (matter fully 
saturated with intelligence), it can manipulate matter and energy to do 
whatever it wants. This perspective has not been considered in 
discussions of future cosmology. It is assumed that intelligence is 
irrelevant to events and processes on a cosmological scale. Stars are 
born and die; galaxies go through their cycles of creation and 
destruction. The Universe itself was born in a big bang and will end 
with a crunch or a whimper, weâre not yet sure which. But intelligence 
has little to do with it. Intelligence is just a bit of froth, an 
ebullition of little creatures darting in and out of inexorable 
universal forces. The mindless mechanism of the Universe is winding up 
or down to a distant future, and thereâs nothing intelligence can do 
about it.</p>
<p>Thatâs the common wisdom, but I donât agree with it. Intelligence 
will be more powerful than these impersonal forces. Once a planet yields
 a technology creating species and that species creates computation (as 
has happened here on Earth), it is only a matter of a few centuries 
before its intelligence saturates the matter and energy in its vicinity,
 and it begins to expand outward at the speed of light or greater. It 
will then overcome gravity (through exquisite and vast technology) and 
other cosmological forces (or, to be fully accurate, will maneuver and 
control these forces) and create the Universe it wants. This is the goal
 of the Singularity.</p>
<p>What kind of Universe will that be? Well, just wait and see.</p>
<h2>Plan to Stick Around</h2>
<p>Most of you (again Iâm using the plural form of the word) are likely 
to be around to see the Singularity. The expanding human life span is 
another one of those exponential trends. In the eighteenth century, we 
added a few days every year to human longevity; during the nineteenth 
century we added a couple of weeks each year; and now weâre adding 
almost a half a year every year. With the revolutions in genomics, 
proteomics, rational drug design, therapeutic cloning of our own organs 
and tissues, and related developments in bio-information sciences, we 
will be adding more than a year every year within ten years. So take 
care of yourself the old fashioned way for just a little while longer, 
and you may actually get to experience the next fundamental paradigm 
shift in our destiny.<br>

     Well, firstly, it needs to be stated that this is a deliciously 
entertaining and well defined hypothesis. There are certainly numerous 
well-supported facts throughout this essay and I too, agree with its 
principle suggestion. It is noteworthy to point out that what this man 
is attempting to prove is at its utmost level not provable (currently), 
but may be able to be in time. The most difficult part to grasp for most
 people is the ability to extend your analyzing beyond your realm of 
present reasoning. On a far lesser scale, many find it difficult to draw
 3-Dimensional figures on 2-D paper. But just because you canât 
comprehend it-or perhaps even if you can and assess that it is only an 
optical illusion-doesnât mean there is no merit in its core reasoning. 
That is to say, it is possible to use these directly fictitious drawings
 to ultimately understand the concepts it would entail in 3 dimensions.<br>
What I am saying is, simply put, that which is impossible now is not 
necessarily impossible later. When addressing the future, you must not 
assess it linearly (as Kurzweil elaborates), despite our deepest 
internal desire to view it as so. If you think A.I. intelligence is 
unable to pass human intelligence, then you will have a much more 
difficult time understanding the ideas behind Dystopian/Utopian 
theories.<br>
On a final note, I truly wonder if these two theories are interrelated, 
as Iâd assume that this could ultimately extend to argue that the 
exponential growth of technology may culminate in a Singularity point 
that ultimately results in the destruction of the exponential model and 
offers an entirely new shape after. (Iâd assume a possible restart in 
technological growth if you believe in Dystopia with a Utopian stance 
being more unclear). I am very interested to hear your take on that.</p>

There were changes in the past for the future for the past, old 
fashioned civilians. Everything is the same, everyone is the same. They 
all think their more godly than others. The fact is, their not. They 
never will beâ¦thereâs only presidentâs and higher occupations who fuck 
up our world and are the higher occupations. So, now we live in the 
Still Age, where nothing seems to move forward. Sure we have technology,
 but nothingâs actually happening. Lifeâs dead, the people may seem 
alive but we are the walking dead. Suppose we donât actually need a 
zombie apocalypse because WE are it. We ARE zombies.<br>
I mean, look at all the movies from the 70â²s/80â²s they expect in the 
2000s/2020s will be all futuristic with hover cars and moving cities and
 blah blah blah but NO, they would be choking themselves now that the 
future hasnât moved on and they saw today. I will be dead by the time 
anything changes to our city or evolvesâ¦.why is it that we canât go out 
by the time night comes? why cant we be creatures of the night instead 
of creatures of the day? Itâs frustrating, sitting here on your bed 
waiting for the next day. The night is not safe for anyone, why? Who 
dared made it that way? I would like to walk in the night feeling safe 
but I suppose that isnt possibleâ¦why is the day safe? But the day isnt 
safe, either. No, I didnât read the preposterous post or comments. Maths
 sucksâ¦I bet I can pass by without using itâ¦thatâs a challengeâ¦okay, so 
maybe the shops I need maths for but thats it and I can use a calculator
 for gods sake! Who the fuck buys 42 melons anyway? You know? Those 
ridiculous math sums. And why, do we see all these people everywhere and
 dont know their names? Their everything? Their always different looking
 everyday. We donât have self awareness because weâre just too used to 
everything, weâre almost like puppets obeying this life systemâ¦we only 
have self awareness when we are in trouble. I mean, I kind of feel like 
weâre just waiting to die everyday. I donât want that. I hate that. I 
want to feel alive, to feel lived, I dont want to walk in a daydream. 
Why must we obey the system? Go to school for half your life, work the 
rest of the half, grow old and die. Everyoneâs the same. Itâs programmed
 for every human. You want to know your purpose? Thatâs your purpose. 
Work till you grow old.<br>
Enjoy the little things ;)</p>

 â respectfully â did you read the whole essay? I agree with your 
criticism in a sense, in that we havenât yet established that there is a
 possible âparadigmâ after integrated circuits. Pointing to the end of 
Mooreâs law and claiming their is nothing beyond that is no different 
than having someone circa 1956 claiming vacuum tubes are the fastest 
computers we can EVER make. Mooreâs law is projected to end sometime 
around 2018 â 2022. Ray is very aware of this, as he points out many 
times in his essay. Had his argument been of the form âMooreâs law â&gt;
 Singularityâ your counter argument would have been sufficient. This is 
not at all what he is arguing, in fact, the premise âMooreâs law will 
endâ is one premises of his argument (the rise an fall of new paradigms 
for intelligence). </p>
<p>If you want to argue against a singularity occurring, you need to 
address the fundamental trends underlying Mooreâs law (things along the 
lines of building upon previous innovations and then work out what laws 
of physics may interfere with the continuation of that trend). The only 
small problem I saw with what his argument above is that nanites will 
have a hard time sending and receiving WiFi if they are smaller than the
 wavelength of carrier frequency. If I were to then conclude that this 
physical problem will prevent nanites from EVER using any kind of 
wireless communication, I would be adopting the same type of thinking as
 yours regarding Mooreâs law. </p>
<p>All of us working together over many years of innovation and 
âevolutionâ have created this smooth pattern (I would argue that ALL 
people contribute in some small way, even the ones that donât appear to 
be doing anything â it all adds up). The patterns you see in a branching
 tree, in the periodic table, in human personality types, a fractal, the
 sand on the beach, a hurricane, the BelousovâZhabotinsky reactionâ¦ take
 your pick but the âLaw of Accelerating Returnsâ as Ray calls it is 
simply another one of those types of patterns. </p>
<p>Itâs literally a force of nature â we recognize that weâre creating 
that pattern, but then we delude ourselves into thinking that weâre âin 
controlâ of it, and that just isnât the case. All of these large scale 
aggregate patterns constructed by an uncountable number of small scale 
chaotic events will be points of great interest for us going forward 
(they already are, but theyâll become more important as we try to solve 
problemsâ¦ like the end of Mooreâs law). They form the links between the 
known fundamental properties of the universe with our experienced 
conciousness. A top priority is to understand that complex and 
interconnected web.</p>

 have two problems with this theory.  The first is physical, the second 
metaphysical.  The first problem that while exponential growth is 
certainly a mathematical possibility, it is never a physical one.  In 
mathematics, all exponential growth results in asymptotes.  There are, 
however, no physical asymptotes â they simply do not exist.  For 
example, the repellent force of protons looks asymptotic until a certain
 point â then it breaks over and nuclear forces take over, binding the 
nucleus of an atom together.  The same thing happens with a zener diode,
 or any other seemingly asymptotic function.  There is always a 
breakover point.  (Interesting discussion regarding the growth of mass 
as it approaches the speed of light â but if you think about it, we 
simply donât know yet).</p>
<p>The second is metaphysical.  This theory assumes â and I think 
incorrectly â that consciousness is the result of increased neural 
activity.  However, any honest person that thinks about it will realize 
that there is something in the âsoulâ or âspiritâ that is yet to be 
explored or understood.  Anyone that has ever entered a room where an 
argument has just taken place and âfeltâ the âtensionâ in the room has 
sensed with something other than the brain â unless all of that is just 
electromagnetic vibes, and as an electrical engineer, I know those 
electromagnetic waves travel outward and disperse at nearly the speed of
 light.  I think that the brain is more of an interface to the âspiritâ 
where real cognitive thinking occurs.  That is why we âstewâ on things 
to think them through â our brain needs to be preoccupied sometimes 
(watching TV, listening to music, etc.) in order to âthinkâ.  Our brain 
doesnât do the thinking, that is a metaphysical thing.  </p>
<p>Thinking that cognitive self-awareness comes from neural activity is a
 stretch that is not supported by any medical knowledge, it is simply 
assumed (like evolution).  It is more of a religion than religion is.  
The complexity of the interface certainly needs to be explored, but 
until we can figure out where the real cognitive engine is, I donât 
think there is any chance that more complex interfaces will become self 
aware.  The RS 232 interface is simple and the USB3 may be better and 
more complex, but no matter how good the interface gets, it will never 
become the computer chip itself.  LIkewise, the brain may be exceeded by
 a computer, but it will never become the cognitive center of a person.</p>
<p>On the bright side, Mr. Kurzweil, the spirit never dies.</p>

to your brain, give credit where creditâs due!</p>

 In mathematics, all exponential growth results in asymptotes. There 
are, however, no physical asymptotes â they simply do not exist.â</p>
<p>There is a physical limit at the end of the century. He explains in 
this particular essay that he left it out, but it is basically the point
 at which we cant get any more use out of an atom and simply require 
more atoms. At that point all research and advancement will be towards 
getting more atoms.<br>
âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ<br>
âThat is why we âstewâ on things to think them through â our brain needs
 to be preoccupied sometimes (watching TV, listening to music, etc.) in 
order to âthinkâ. Our brain doesnât do the thinking, that is a 
metaphysical thing.â</p>
<p>We are unaware of the vast majority of our brains activity. This is 
the work being done in the subconscious. We are only aware of the 
activity on the thin outer film on the outside of the brain, and we have
 even shown that many of the decisions we think we consciously make were
 actually your subconscious making the decision and lying to you 
conscious brain that you made the decision. You can tell these 
âdecisionsâ apart from the rest by asking yourself if you actually 
considered alternatives to what you just did; if not, that is your 
subconscious. Your subconscious considers almost every thing you could 
possibly do next, and analyzes the world in very unconventional waysâ¦ 
sometimes seeing past our rigid conception of reality. 95% of our brain 
is in the subconscious. Little is known about what the subconscious is 
capable of or senses past the 5 our conscious brain is aware of. Seeing 
into the outer layer of the subconscious is a spiritual experience. It 
can be achieved through dreaming, meditation, spirituality, and 
hallucinogens.<br>
When you âfeelâ things you are not aware of or âstewâ, this is your subconscious working away. This is the real you.<br>
âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ<br>
âThinking that cognitive self-awareness comes from neural activity is a 
stretch that is not supported by any medical knowledge, it is simply 
assumedâ </p>
<p>Self awareness is shown to take place in the brain only when it is in
 a highly interconnected state. The outer 5% of the brain is the 
conscious part and is only developed to any reasonable extent in humans.
 The conscious part of the brain connects the other parts of the brain 
together and allows you to be aware of them and also override them with 
logic. Scientific inquiry into this by watching chain reactions in the 
brain has shown that when are are no longer self aware, the difference 
in the brain is that the separate parts are no longer communicating with
 each otherâ¦they are simply acting. This is how it is in animals.</p>

 not sure that I agree with the Kurzweilâs refutation of Penroseâs 
description of the origin of consciousness.  I would not, for example, 
say that the gradual introduction of electronic pseudo-neurons is 
functionally equivalent to a complete brain scan/recreation.  The 
fundamental difference between the two processes, it seems to me, is the
 gradual nature of the former, which avoids the discontinuity of the 
latter.  </p>
<p>Continuity may be fundamental to consciousness, which is why 
Penroseâs argument holds water. No matter how âcloseâ our quantum 
technology can come to replicating our quantum states, there will always
 be that discontinuity because the duplication, as Penrose argues, 
cannot be perfect. Therefore, consciousness cannot be downloaded from a 
biological mind.</p>
<p>Of course, consciousness could also be something completely unrelated
 to all of this. Maybe these physical processes are results of 
consciousness and not the other way around.</p>

 new invention has a beginning, an accellerating development phase, a 
peak of development and then a decellerating slowing down of 
development. Nothing takes forever. Eventually we will live in a world 
that doesnât change much. You just think it is linear or exponentially 
accellerating because you donât appreciate that the 
industrial/technological time has been very short. Itâs like looking at 
our world and thinking it is flat but when you get to the pole it goes 
no further. Itâs just a ball. You canât see the reality because you

 think the jump from â the window that a civilization would be

civilizations would be broadcasting a signal to all the universe once
