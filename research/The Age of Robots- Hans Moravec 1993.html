<h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>

<dd><i>Our artifacts are getting smarter, and a loose parallel with the
evolution of animal intelligence suggests one future course for them.
Computerless industrial machinery exhibits the behavioral flexibility
of single-celled organisms.  Today's best computer-controlled robots
are like the simpler invertebrates.  A thousand-fold increase in
computer power in this decade should make possible machines with
reptile-like sensory and motor competence.  Properly configured, such
robots could do in the physical world what personal computers now do
in the world of data--act on our behalf as literal-minded slaves.
Growing computer power over the next half-century will allow this
reptile stage will be surpassed, in stages producing robots that learn
like mammals, model their world like primates and eventually reason
like humans.  Depending on your point of view, humanity will then have
produced a worthy successor, or transcended inherited limitations and
transformed itself into something quite new.  No longer limited by the
slow pace of human learning and even slower biological evolution,
intelligent machinery will conduct its affairs on an ever faster, ever
smaller scale, until coarse physical nature has been converted to
fine-grained purposeful thought.</i><br><br>

_________________________________<br><br>

</dd><dd>Serious attempts to build thinking machines began after the second
world war.  One line of research, called Cybernetics, used simple
electronic circuitry to mimic small nervous systems, and produced
machines that could learn to recognize simple patterns, and
turtle-like robots that found their way to lighted recharging hutches.
An entirely different approach, named Artificial Intelligence (AI),
attempted to harness the apparently prodigious power of post-war
computers--able to do the arithmetical work of thousands of
mathematicians--to more interesting kind of thinking.  And indeed, by
1965, computers ran programs that proved theorems in logic and
geometry, solved calculus problems and played good games of checkers.
In the early 1970s, AI research groups at MIT and Stanford University
attached television cameras and robot arms to their computers, so
their "thinking" programs could begin to collect their information
directly from the real world.<br><br>

</dd><dd>What a shock!  While the pure reasoning programs did their jobs
about as well and about as fast as college freshmen, the best robot
control programs took hours to find and pick up a few blocks on a
table.  Often these robots failed completely, giving a performance
much worse than a six month old child.  This disparity between
programs that reason and programs that perceive and act in the real
world holds to this day.  In recent years Carnegie Mellon University
produced two desk-sized computers that can play chess at grandmaster
level, within the top 100 players in the world, when given their moves
on a keyboard.  But present-day robotics could produce only a complex
and unreliable machine for finding and moving physical chess
pieces.<br><br>

</dd><dd>In hindsight it seems that, in an absolute sense, reasoning is
much easier than perceiving and acting--a position not hard to
rationalize in evolutionary terms.  The survival of human beings (and
their ancestors) has depended for hundreds of millions of years on
seeing and moving in the physical world, and in that competition large
parts of their brains have become efficiently organized for the task.
But we didn't appreciate this monumental skill because it is shared by
every human being and most animals--it is commonplace.  On the other
hand, rational thinking, as in chess, is a newly acquired skill,
perhaps less than one hundred thousand years old.  The parts of our
brain devoted to it are not well organized, and, in an absolute sense,
we're not very good at it.  But until recently we had no competition
to show us up.<br><br>

</dd><dd>By comparing the edge and motion detecting circuitry in the four
layers of nerve cells in the retina, the best understood major circuit
in the human nervous system, with similar processes developed for
"computer vision" systems that allow robots in research and industry
to see, I've estimated that it would take a billion computations per
second (the power of an average supercomputer) to produce the same
results at the same speed as a human retina.  By extrapolation, to
emulate a whole brain takes ten trillion arithmetic operations per
second, or ten thousand supercomputers worth.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Machines have a lot of catching up to do.  On the other hand, for
most of the century, machine calculation has been improving a
thousandfold every twenty years, and there are basic developments in
research labs that can sustain this for at least several decades more.
In less than fifty years computer hardware should be powerful enough
to match, and exceed, even the well-developed parts of human
intelligence. But what about the software that would be required to
give these powerful machines the ability to perceive, intuit and think
as well as humans?  The Cybernetic approach that attempts to directly
imitate nervous systems is very slow, partly because examining a
working brain in detail is a very tedious process.  New instruments
may change that in future.  The AI approach has successfully imitated
some aspects of rational thought, but that seems to be only about one
millionth of the problem. I feel that the fastest progress on the
hardest problems will come from a third approach, the newer field of
robotics, the construction of systems that must see and move in the
physical world.  Robotics research is imitating the
<i>evolution</i> of animal minds, adding capabilities to
machines a few at a time, so that the resulting sequence of machine
behaviors resembles the capabilities of animals with increasingly
complex nervous systems.  This effort to build intelligence from the
bottom up is helped by biological peeks at the "back of the book"--at
the neuronal, structural, and behavioral features of animals and
humans.<br><br>

</dd><dd>The best robots today are controlled by computers just powerful
enough to simulate the nervous system of an insect, cost as much as
houses, and so find only a few profitable niches in society (among
them, spray painting and spot welding cars and assembling
electronics).  But those few applications are encouraging research
that is slowly providing a base for a huge future growth.  Robot
evolution in the direction of full intelligence will greatly
accelerate, I believe, in about a decade when the mass-produced
general purpose, <i>universal</i> robot becomes possible.  These
machines will do in the physical world what personal computers do in
the world of data--act on our behalf as literal-minded slaves.<br><br>

<h3><b>First-Generation Universal Robots</b></h3>

<i>Timeframe: 2000-2010<br>
Processing power: 1,000 MIPS (1993 supercomputer -- Reptile-class)<br>
Distinguishing feature: General-purpose perception, manipulation and
mobility</i><br><br>

</dd><dd>A robot's activities are assembled from its fundamental perception
and action repertoire.  First-generation robots will exist in a world
built for humans, and that repertoire most usefully would resemble a
human's.  The general size, shape and strength of the machine should
be human-like, to allow passage through and reach into the same
spaces.  Its mobility should be efficient on flat ground, where most
tasks will happen, but also reliable and safe over stairs and rough
ground, lest the robot be trapped on single-floor "islands."  It
should be able to manipulate most everyday objects, and to find them
in the nearby world.  The components of this machine exist in
laboratories worldwide, and suggest guidelines for a practical design
this decade.<br><br>

</dd><dd>1,000 MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second) is just enough
computing power for a moving robot to maintain a coarse map of its
surroundings and use it for locating itself relative to trained
itineraries and to plan and control driving.  When not traveling,
there is power enough to construct a fine map of a manipulator
workspace, to locate particular objects and to plan and control arm
motions.  When not occupied with its unique robotic functions, the
robot should share with personal computers of its time the ability to
communicate over wireless networks, to generate and interpret spoken
sentences and to generate and read printed text.  Programs for
specific applications--many obtained via high-speed networks--will
orchestrate these basics to accomplish useful tasks.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Universal robots will find their first uses in factories,
warehouses and offices, where they will be more versatile than the
older generation of robots they replace.  Because of their breadth of
applicability, their numbers should grow rapidly, and their costs
decline.  Eventually they will become cheap enough for some
households, extending the utility of personal computers from a few
tasks in the data world to many in the physical world.  Perhaps a
program for housecleaning will be included with each robot, as
word-processing programs were shipped with early personal
computers.<br><br>

</dd><dd>As with computers, some applications of robots will surprise their
manufacturers.  Robot programs may be developed to do light mechanical
work (assembling other robots, for example), deliver warehoused
inventories, prepare specific gourmet meals, tune up certain types of
car, hook patterned rugs, weed lawns, run races, play games, arrange
earth, stone and brick or sculpt.  Some tasks will need specialized
hardware attachments like tools and chemical sensors.  Each
application will require its own original software, very complex by
today's computer program standards.  The programs will contain modules
for recognizing, grasping, manipulating, transporting and assembling
particular items--modules developed via learning programs on
supercomputers (with about 100,000 MIPS).  In time, a growing library
of subtask modules may ease the construction of new programs.<br><br>

</dd><dd>A first-generation robot will have the brain power of a reptile,
but most application programs will be so hard pressed to accomplish
their primary functions that they will endow the robot with the
personality of a washing machine.<br><br>

<h3><b>Second-Generation Universal Robots</b></h3>

<i>Timeframe: 2010-2020<br>
Processing power: 30,000 MIPS (Mammal-class)<br>
Distinguishing feature: Accommodation learning</i><br><br>

</dd><dd>First-generation robots will be rigid slaves to inflexible
programs, relentless in pursuing their tasks--or repeating their
errors.  Their programs will contain the frozen results of learning
done on bigger computers under human supervision.  Except for
specialized episodes like recording a new cleaning route or the
location of work objects, they will be incapable of learning new
skills or adapting to unanticipated circumstances--even modest
alterations of behavior will require new programming, probably from
the original software suppliers.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Second-generation robots, with thirty times the processing power,
will be more adaptable, because they can do some learning onboard.
The fundamental idea in adaptive learning is to "close the loop" on
behavior: to evaluate each action's effect in a given context to
enhance the process that generated the action.  In the simplest
technique, a behavioral alternative that succeeds becomes more likely
to be invoked in similar circumstances, while an alternative that
fails becomes less probable.  Faster statistical-learning approaches
like neural nets repeatedly tweak behavior-control parameters to nudge
actual responses closer to an ideal.  Programs for second-generation
robots will use many such learning techniques, creating new
abilities--and new pitfalls.<br><br>

</dd><dd>If a first-generation robot working in your kitchen runs into
trouble--say, failing to complete a key step because a portion of the
workspace is awkwardly small--you have to option of abandoning the
task, changing its environment, or somehow obtaining altered software
that accomplishes the problematic step in a different way.  A
second-generation robot will make a number of false starts, but most
probably will find its own solution, adjust to its home in thousands
of more subtle ways, and gradually improve its performance.  While a
first-generation robot's personality is determined entirely by the
sequence of operations in the application program it runs at the
moment, a second-generation robot's character is more a product of the
suite of conditioning programs it hosts.  The conditioning system
might, in time, censor an entire application program, if it gave
consistently negative results.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Second-generation robots of 2010 will have onboard computers as
powerful as the supercomputers that learned for first-generation
machines in 2000.  But by 2010, supercomputers will be proportionally
more powerful (about 3,000,000 MIPS), and will themselves play a
background role for the second-generation.  The many individual
programs of a conditioning suite--each responding to some specific
stimulus--interact with one another and with the robot's control
programs and environment in ways that will be far too entangled to
anticipate accurately.  It would be possible to evaluate particular
suites by trying them out in robots--the acid test in any case--but
that would be a slow and dangerous way to sift a large number of rough
candidates--some would certainly behave in unexpected ways that could
damage the robot, or even endanger the testers.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Faster and safer initial screenings might be done in factory
supercomputer simulations of robots in action.  To be of value,
simulations would have to be good models, predicting accurately such
things as the probability that a given grip can lift a particular
object, or that a vision module can find a given something in
particular clutter.  Simulating the everyday world in full physical
detail will still be beyond computer capacity in 2010, but it should
be possible to approximate the results by generalizing data collected
from actual robots: essentially to learn from the working experience
of real robots how everyday things behave.  A large systematic
collection effort under human supervision will probably be necessary
lest there be too many gaps or distortions.  A proper simulator would
contain at least thousands of learned models for various basic
interactions (call them <i>interaction primitives</i>), in what
amounts to a robotic version of common-sense physics.<br><br>

<h3><b>Third-Generation Universal Robots</b></h3>

<i>Timeframe: 2020-2030<br>
Processing power: 1,000,000 MIPS (Primate-class)<br>
Distinguishing feature: World modeling</i><br><br>

</dd><dd>Adaptive second-generation robots will find jobs everywhere, and
may become the largest industry on earth.  But teaching them new
skills, whether by writing programs or through training, will be very
tedious.  A third generation of universal robot, with onboard
computers as powerful as the supercomputers that optimized
second-generation programs, will learn much faster because they do
much of the trial and error in fast simulation rather than slow and
dangerous physicality.  Once again, a process done by human-supervised
supercomputers at the factory in one robot generation will be improved
and installed directly onboard the next generation, and once again new
opportunities and new problems will arise.<br><br>

</dd><dd>With a simulator onboard, it becomes possible for a robot to
maintain a running account of the actual events going on around it--to
simulate its world in real time.  Doing so requires that almost
everything the robot senses be recognized for the kind of object it
is, so that the proper models of interaction can called up.
Recognizing arbitrary objects by sight is as difficult as knowing how
they will interact: it will require modules specially trained for each
kind of thing (call them <i>perception primitives</i>).  Some
perception primitives may already have been developed for
second-generation factory simulators, to help automate the tedious job
of creating simulations of robot workspaces, but an additional effort
to fill gaps and systematize them will surely be necessary to prepare
them for fully automatic use in the third generation.  Perception
primitives will allow a robot's three-dimensional map of a room to be
transformed into a working model, as each object is identified and
linked with its proper interaction primitives.<br><br>

</dd><dd>A continuously updated simulation of self and surroundings gives a
robot interesting abilities.  By running the simulation slightly
faster than real time, the robot can preview what it is about to do,
in time to alter its intent if the simulation predicts it will turn
out badly--a kind of consciousness.  On a larger scale, before
undertaking a new task, the robot can simulate it many times, with
conditioning system engaged, learning from the simulated experiences
as it would from physical ones.  Consequently well trained for the
task, it would likely succeed the first time it attempted it
physically--unlike a second-generation machine, which must make all
its mistakes out in real life.  When it has some spare time, the robot
can replay previous experiences, and try variations on them, perhaps
learning ways to improve future performance.  A sufficiently advanced
third-generation robot, whose simulation extends to other
agents--robots and people--would be able to observe a task being done
by someone else, and formulate a program for doing the task itself: it
could imitate.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Though they will be able to adapt, imitate and create simple
programs of their own, third-generation robots will still rely on
externally supplied programs to do complicated jobs.  Since their
motor and perceptual functions will be quite sophisticated, and their
memories and potential skills large, it will be possible to write
wonderfully elaborate control programs for them, accomplishing large
jobs, with nuances within nuances.  It will be increasingly difficult
for human programmers to keep track of the many details and
interactions.  Fortunately, the task can be largely automated.
Shakey, the first computer-controlled mobile robot, developed at SRI
in the late 1960s, had at its heart a reasoning program called STRIPS
(STanford Research Institute Problem Solver) that expressed the
robot's situation and capabilities as sentences of symbolic logic, and
solved for the sequence of actions that achieved a requested result as
a proof of a mathematical theorem.  In 1969, on computers with a mere
0.1 MIPS, neither the theorem prover nor the sensory processing which
provided its input could handle the complexity of realistic
situations, and Shakey was limited to maneuvering around a few blocks.
Nevertheless, the idea was sound: given a correct description of the
initial and desired state of the world, and enough time and space to
work, a theorem prover will find an absolutely correct solution, of
whatever generality, subtlety and deviousness is required, if one
exists at all.  By the time of the third universal robot generation,
supercomputers will provide 100,000,000 MIPS, and (thanks to
continuing progress in the top-down Artificial Intelligence industry)
programs will exist which will be able to STRIPS-like reasoning with
real world richness.  So factory supercomputers in 2025 will accept
complex goals (find a sequence of robot actions which assembles the
robot described in the following design database), and compile them
via theorem provers into wonderfully intricate control programs for
third-generation robots, which will, in turn adapt them to their
actual circumstances.<br><br>

<h3><b>Fourth-Generation Universal Robots</b></h3>

<i>Timeframe: 2030-2040<br>
Processing power: 3,000,000 MIPS (Human-class)<br>
Distinguishing feature: Reasoning</i><br><br>

</dd><dd>In the decades while the "bottom-up" evolution of robots is slowly
transferring the perceptual and motor faculties of human beings into
machinery, the conventional Artificial Intelligence industry will be
perfecting the mechanization of reasoning.  Since today's programs
already match human beings in some areas, those of 40 years from now,
running on computers a million times as fast as today's, should be
quite superhuman.  Today's reasoning programs work from small amounts
of unambiguous information prepared by human beings--data from robot
sensors such as cameras is much too voluminous and too noisy for them
to use.  But a good robot simulator will contain neatly organized and
labeled descriptions of the robot and its world, ready to answer
questions from a reasoning program asking, for instance, if a knife is
on a countertop, or if the robot is holding a cup, or even if a human
is angry<br><br>

</dd><dd>Fourth-generation universal robots will have computers powerful
enough to simultaneously simulate the world, and reason about the
simulation.  Like the factory supercomputers of the third-generation,
fourth generation robots will be able to devise ultra-sophisticated
robot programs, for other robots or for themselves.  Because of
another gift from the Artificial Intelligence industry, they will also
be able to understand natural languages.  While the original language
understanders will probably use a verbal common-sense database similar
to the one being developed by the Cyc project, where the meaning of
words is defined in reference only to other words, in a
fourth-generation robot some concepts and statements will be
understood more deeply, through the action of the simulator.  When
someone tells the robot "<i>the water is running in the bathtub</i>"
the robot can update its simulation of the world to include flow into
the unseen tub, where a simulated extrapolation would indicate an
undesirable overflow later, and so motivate the robot to go to turn
off the tap.  A purely verbal representation might accomplish the same
thing if it included the statements such as "A filling bathtub will
overflow if its water is not shut off," but a modest number of general
principles in a simulator, interacting in combinations, can provide
the equivalent information of an indefinite number of sentences.
Similarly a reasoning program, making inferences about physical
things, might be enhanced by a simulator: candidate inferences would
rejected if they failed in a parallel simulation of a typical case,
and, conversely, persistent coincidences in the simulation could
suggest statements that can be proved--the robot would be visualizing
as it listened, spoke and reasoned.  A modest but very successful
version of such an approach was used in one of the earliest Artificial
Intelligence programs, a geometry theorem prover by Herbert Gelernter
in 1959.  Starting with the postulates and rules of inference in
Euclid's "Elements," Gelernter's program proved some of the theorems,
using algebraic "diagrams" to eliminate false directions in the
proofs.  Before attempting to prove two triangles congruent in a
certain construction, for instance, the program would generate an
example of the construction, using random numbers for the unspecified
quantities, and measure the resulting triangles.  If they were not
sufficiently similar--within the precision of the arithmetic--the
program abandoned that approach and tried something else.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Simulator-augmented language understanding and reasoning may be so
effective in robots that it will be adopted for use in plain computer
programs, "grounding" them in the physical world via the experiences
of the robots that tuned the simulators.  In time the distinction
between robot controllers and disembodied reasoners will diminish, and
reasoning programs will sometimes link to robot bodies to interact
physically with the world, and robot minds will sometimes retire into
large computers, to do some intense thinking off-line.<br><br>

</dd><dd>A fourth-generation robot will be able to accept statements of
purpose from humans, and "compile" them into detailed programs that
accomplish the task.  With a database about the world at large the
statements could become quite general--things like "earn a living",
"make more robots" or "make a smarter robot."  In fact, fourth
generation robots will have the general competence of human beings,
and resemble us in some ways, but in others be like nothing the world
has seen before.  As they design their own successors, the world will
become ever stranger.<br><br>

<h3><b>The Short Run (early 2000s)</b></h3>

</dd><dd>As the industrial revolution gathered steam two centuries ago, it
destroyed cottage industries and concentrated wealth in he hands of
factory owners--the capitalists.  Millions of displaced home workers
competed for too few jobs tending the new machines.  It took difficult
political readjustments to equalize the benefits of cheaper, more
plentiful goods, but gradually laborers' hours were halved, creating
need for more workers, and so bidding up salaries.  Though it
increases communal wealth, each increment in automation threatens a
similar unpleasant transient, as it displaces one group of workers
with fewer doing different tasks.  If the new required skills are
common, mass competition for the few jobs drives down salaries.  If
the skills are rare, scarcity encourages high pay and long hours.
Either way, some work excessively while others are jobless--and it
takes slow changes in the social contract and in education to level
the load.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Though work hours will decline, they cannot be the final answer to
rising productivity.  In the next century inexpensive but capable
robots will displace human labor so broadly that the average workday
would have to plummet to practically zero to keep everyone usefully
employed.  Already, much labor services more questionable
needs--gargantuan government bureaucracies, cosmetic medicine, mass
entertainment, and speculative writing, to give a few examples.  In
time almost all humans may work to amuse other humans, while robots
run competitive primary industries, like food production and
manufacturing.  There is a problem with this picture.  The "service
economy" functions today because many humans willing to buy services
work in the primary industries, and so return money to the service
providers, who in turn use it to buy life's essentials.  As the pool
of humans in the primary industries evaporates, the return channel
chokes off--efficient, no-nonsense robots will not engage in frivolous
consumption.  Money will accumulate in the industries, enriching any
people still remaining there, and become scarce among the service
providers.  Prices for primary products will plummet, reflecting both
the reduced costs of production, and the reduced means of the
consumers.  In the ridiculous extreme, no money would flow back, and
the robots would fill warehouses with essential goods which the human
consumers could not buy.<br><br>

</dd><dd>The scenario above is incomplete.  Not all individuals involved in
productive enterprises actually work there.  Stockholders, having once
contributed capital to a thriving enterprise, may collect dividends
indefinitely.  Workers can be replaced by something more efficient,
but in the present legal system, owners remain unless they sell out.
Even with total automation, human business proprietors will continue
to profit, and so be able to patronize the service providers.  An
analogous situation existed in classical and feudal times, where an
impoverished, overworked majority of slaves or serfs played the role
of robots, and land ownership played the role of capital.  In between
the serfs and the lords, a working population struggled to make a
living from secondary sources, often by performing services for the
privileged.  The most prestigious and prosperous commoners sold high
quality products and services directly to the gentry (as in the proud
line still seen in Britain, <i>By Appointment to Her
Majesty</i>).  A larger number lived less well by trading with
other townspeople.<br><br>

</dd><dd>It is unlikely that a future majority of service-providing
"commoners" with more free time, communications and democracy than
today, would tolerate being lorded over by a minority of non-working
hereditary capitalists: they would vote to change the system.  The
trend in the social democracies has been to equalize income by raising
the standards of the poorest as high as the economy can bear--in the
age of robots, that minimum will be very high.  In the early 1980s
James Albus, head of the automation division of the then National
Bureau of Standards, suggested that the negative effects of total
automation could be avoided by giving all citizens stock in trusts
that owned automated industries, making everyone a capitalist.  Those
who chose to squander their birthright could work for others, but most
would simply live off their stock income.  Even today, the public
indirectly owns a majority of the capital in the country, through
compounding private pension funds.  In the United States, universal
coverage could be achieved through the social security system.  Social
security was originally presented as a pension fund that accumulated
wages for retirement, but in practice it transfers income from workers
to retirees.  The system will probably be subsidized from general
taxes in coming decades, when too few workers are available to support
the post World War II "baby boom."  Incremental expansion of such a
subsidy would let money from robot industries, collected as corporate
taxes, be returned to the general population as pension payments.  By
gradually lowering the retirement age towards birth, most of the
population would eventually be supported.  The money could be
distributed under other names, but calling it a pension is meaningful
symbolism: we are describing the long, comfortable retirement of the
entire original-model human race.<br><br>

<h3><b>The Medium Run (around 2050)</b></h3>

</dd><dd>What happens to people when work becomes passe?  Existing
retirement communities are probably too sleepy to be a good
model--most of the individuals there have completed their life's work,
and are of declining vigor and health.  Better examples may be the
richest Arabian petro-kingdoms, where oil-bought foreign labor plays
the role of total automation.  In a tradition of tribal sharing shaped
by a sparsely-furnished nomadic past, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates have managed to spread the new wealth broadly
among the citizenry in a single generation.  Free health care and
education, and undemanding government jobs, or outright welfare,
secure life's needs, and life expectancies and literacy rates are
among the world's highest.  Comfort and security mute the stresses of
civilization, including the tension between circumscribed Islamic
values and the liberties of a wealthy world culture.  The societies
produce both world-class achievers and criminals, but on average show
less driven urgency than many industrialized nations: most of their
citizens seem happy to simply live their lives, and stability is
endangered only by neighboring countries, where impoverished
majorities are less content with the status quo.  In numerous smaller
examples, wealthy families often produce generations of content, even
smug, heirs (as well as exceptions to titillate the tabloids).<br><br>

</dd><dd>Contrary to fears of some enmeshed in civilization's work ethic,
our tribal past prepared us well for lives as idle rich.  In a good
climate and location the hunter-gatherer's lot can be pleasant indeed:
an afternoon's outing picking berries or catching fish--what we
civilized types would recognize as a recreational weekend--provides
life's needs for several days.  The rest of the time can be spent with
children, socializing or simply resting.  Of course, our ancestors had
also to survive hard times, and evolution bequeathed us the capacity
for desperate measures, including hard work.  Civilization turned that
extremity into everyday normality, and now stress is the leading cause
of disease, and probably triggers some of the ugliest aspects of
tribalism.  In primates, overpopulation is a common reason for group
distress, as nature-provided food and shelter falls short.  To
survive, a strong tribe may chase away or exterminate a weaker
neighbor, or drive out or otherwise eliminate some of its own members:
maybe those who smell, look, sound or act differently.  Sometimes
stressed individuals become accident or disease prone, and die
spontaneously, improving the prospects for their relatives--similar
considerations could regulate the prevalence of non-reproductive
behaviors like homosexuality.  City life, absurdly crowded and
stressful by tribal-village standards, may inappropriately activate
unconscious overpopulation reflexes--the self-destructive emotional
vehemence of ethnic strife hardly reflects rational self-interest.  It
will harder to stir up battle fervor against minorities from the
luxurious lassitude of a robot-supported life.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Ultra-conservative Switzerland may be a hint of things to come.
Government and commercial institutions perfected through centuries of
peace (interrupted only briefly by Napoleon) have given Switzerland
unmatched prosperity, stability and security.  Most Swiss citizens
work, but they do so comfortably, with generous government
welfare--and Italian immigrant labor--having lessened the desperation
that forces workers elsewhere into unpleasant jobs.  Comfortable
prosperity has allowed multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-language
Switzerland, made of 23 fiercely independent Cantons each with its own
traditions and history, to peacefully endure the most severe internal
differences of opinion, for instance the political fury between German
and French factions during the first World War.  The average Swiss
citizen may resist most major changes (why ruin a good thing?), but
Switzerland produces world-class contributors in all fields--if a bit
less flamboyance than average.  While it gives everyone the
opportunity to excel, it lacks the social trauma that drives some
other countries.  Few Swiss would prefer it otherwise.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Many trends in industrialized countries presage a future of humans
supported by a rich robot economy, as our ancestors were supplied by
their ecology (call it paradise with plumbing).  Technology and global
competition are gradually depopulating businesses.  Even absent
universal robots, increasingly flexible automation is displacing labor
in food production and manufacture, while communicating computers are
replacing clerks, secretaries, and managers in offices.  Jobs that
still require human labor are moving to the homes of computer-equipped
"tele-commuters" (like this author) who report reduced stress and
improved family life.  In a ripple effect, smaller work staffs imply
less catering, janitorial and maintenance support.  In future, as
smarter computers, able to handle policy making, public relations,
law, engineering and research replace the last telecommuters, and as
capable robots displace technicians, janitors, vehicle drivers and
construction crews, it will only be common sense for a population to
vote itself income from taxes on labor-free but superbly productive
industries.  Less developed countries might rapidly catch up by
offering the same industries location and raw materials at lower tax
cost--a trained population will no longer be a requirement.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Western democracies may come to resemble lazier Switzerlands, but
with large differences.  Big cities will lose their economic
advantages, and may begin to evaporate, as individuals, linked to the
world by high fidelity communications and served by personal robots,
scatter to areas offering more elbow room.  Large countries may
similarly become less important, as taxes on local industries, and
local robot labor, become adequate to supply all human needs.  The
civilized world may again return to a comfortable tribalism, after a
five millennium detour into organized civilization.  Countries with
traditional tribal structures may simply stay that way, building on
their ancestral customs, leapfrogging urbanization altogether, while
developed countries foster tribes with customs and beliefs that exceed
even today's notion of bizarre.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Tribalism will express itself in entirely novel ways.  Over the
last two decades, inter linked computer networks have hosted small
communities whose members happen to be distributed around the world.
In 1993 the informal "Usenet" had about ten million subscribers,
carrying on about three thousand specialized discussions on every
conceivable topic, some with fifty page-long messages every day.
Regular contributors to a particular "newsgroup" soon begin to
recognize one another, and develop characteristic interactions, likes
and dislikes.  They form factions that praise, recruit, condemn and
ostracize.  When a newsgroup grows too large and noisy, specialized
subgroups are formed, reducing the original group's population.  In
future, the world networks will have much greater capacity, and new
abilities, such as language translation.  "Tribes of common interest"
will share more than written text, perhaps exchanging voice and video,
or manifesting themselves in full sensory 3D, in synthesized virtual
realities: tribal lands that exist in the minds of computers, in
greater number, variety and accessibility than possible in the
physical world.<br><br>

</dd><dd>While computer simulations create entirely new worlds, robots will
transform physical life.  Today, manufactured items are difficult to
make, and thus relatively rare and expensive, and we expend great
effort in acquiring and defending them--our homes are fortified
warehouses of our possessions.  Stockpiling will be less appropriate
amidst robotic abundance: why hoard fruit in an orchard?  Conventional
manufacturing methods--molding, casting, milling, assembly--can be
robotically orchestrated to make new items fairly quickly.  Even
better, robotic accuracy and patience can build up solid objects by
precisely "painting" various materials, layer upon cross-sectional
layer.  Such new approaches, refined to molecular resolution (done now
modestly in scanning tunneling microscopes) will produce arbitrary
solid objects from computer descriptions.  Humans may be able to live
in uncluttered spaces--in ecological preserves, if they choose--yet
have any needed item, perhaps even food or housing, made on the spot,
or delivered from small local caches--then disassembled back into into
raw materials after use.  The most visible technological products
remaining may be robots themselves, in various sizes and shapes, and
these may lurk unobtrusively until called upon.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Robots that live among humans, providing goods and services, will
themselves be consumer products, styled, outfitted and programmed to
please the customers.  They will be manufactured by very different
robots that extract energy and raw materials and perform major
engineering, exploration and research projects.  Molded by the
constraints of the physical world rather than by human whim, these
worker machines are likely to become ever more varied in size, shape
and function, forming an entire ecology of artificial life that will
eventually surpass the existing biosphere in diversity.  The first
fully automated companies, evolved from existing firms, will be in
familiar industrial settings near population centers.  As human labor
becomes superfluous, economics will dictate cheaper sites, perhaps
locations that humans find unpleasant because they are too hot, too
cold, too dry, too poisonous, too far underground or too
remote.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Robot companies will be shaped by future editions of existing
laws, by taxes, and by consumer demand.  Existing laws give
incorporated entities some of the rights of a person, most importantly
the right to own property and make contracts.  They do not grant the
right to life--corporations may legally be killed by competition or
through legal or financial actions.  Corporations are bound by laws
similar to those that regulate humans, and can be punished through
fines, operating restrictions or dissolution--even without humans to
fine, imprison or execute.  Corporations stay alive by building and
maintaining physical assets that generate income to pay their
expenses.  In the mid 21st century, the biggest expense will be
taxation, and income will come mostly from choosy human
customers.<br><br>

</dd><dd> Tax laws will be shaped by human voters: there is no precedent or
motivation for extending suffrage to robots, and the vote will be one
of the very few advantages humans retain.  Some debate is inevitable,
but there should be few qualms about keeping even very superior
thinking machines in disenfranchised bondage.  It takes force,
indoctrination and constant vigilance to counter inherited needs and
motivations and enslave a human, but a robot can be constructed to
enjoy the role.  Natural evolution itself has provided examples, in
worker castes of social insects, and self-sacrificing mothers of all
species.<br><br>

</dd><dd>The primary job of voters in the next century will be protecting
their retirement benefits, that is ensuring that robot industries
continue to support them.  The robots will present a moving target,
but the instruments of control will also grow in power.  Not only will
companies that get out of line be liable for punishment--if necessary,
by force purchased from other companies--but they can be controlled
a-priori by intrusions directly into their software.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Corporate intelligences may be governed by structures like those
controlling fourth-generation robots.  Immensely powerful reasoning
and simulation modules will plan complex actions, but the desirability
of possible outcomes will be defined by much simpler positive and
negative conditioning modules (or by sets of axioms in super-rational
systems), whose composition shapes the character of the entire entity.
Humans can buy enormous safety by mandating an elaborate analog of
Isaac Asimov's three "Laws of Robotics" in this corporate
character--perhaps the entire body of corporate law, with human rights
and anti-trust provisions, and appropriate relative weightings to
resolve conflicts.  Robot corporations so constituted will have no
desire to cheat, though they may sometimes find creative
interpretations of the laws--which will consequently require a period
of tuning to insure their intended spirit.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Internalized laws, properly adjusted, should produce
extraordinarily trustworthy entities, happy to die to ensure their
legality.  Even so, accident, unintended interactions or human malice
could occasionally produce a rogue robot or corporation, with
superhuman intelligence and unpleasant goals.  "Police" clauses in the
core corporate laws, inducing legal corporations to collectively
suppress outlaws, by withholding services, or even with force, would
mitigate the danger.  Overall safety would be enhanced by anti-trust
provisions that limit collusion and cause overgrown corporations to
divide into competing entities, ensuring diversity and multiplicity.
In the next section we discuss activities in the solar system that
could threaten Earth: in response, police clauses might be expanded in
scope to support a planetary defense.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Like basic food in today's developed countries, common
manufactured goods in the next century will be too cheap and plentiful
to be very profitable.  To pay their taxes, most companies will be
forced to continually invent unique products and services in a race
against competitors to attract increasingly sophisticated (or jaded)
human consumers.  Automated research, as superhumanly systematic,
industrious and speedy as robot manufacturing, will generate a
succession of new products, as well as improved robot researchers and
models of the physical and social world.  The likely results will
exceed the dreams of science fiction: robotic playmates, virtual
realities and personalized works of art that stir the emotions like
nothing before, medical solutions for every physical, mental or
cosmetic whim, answers to satisfy any curiosity, luxury visits
anywhere in the solar system, and things yet to be imagined.  The
existence of an astronomically increasing variety of consumer choices
will accelerate the divergence of human tribes: some may choose a
comfortable imitation of an earlier period (as the Amish today), but
others will push the human envelope in wisdom, pleasure, beauty,
ugliness, spirituality, banality and every other direction.  The
choices made by diverse communities will shape robot evolution--only
companies able to devise services of interest to the customers will
generate enough income to survive.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Humans too will be shaped by the relationship.  Robot services
will be inexpensive, but not free, and income will be finite.
Corporations will operate globally, but taxes will increasingly be
assessed on and redistributed on a tribal scale.  Tribes that tax too
heavily will drive away the corporations, and so eliminate their
revenue--like tribes of the past that overburdened their ecology, they
will learn modesty of expectation.  More subtly, corporations
struggling to appeal to consumers will develop and act on increasingly
detailed and accurate models of human psychology.  The
superintelligences, just doing their job, will peer into the workings
of human minds--and manipulate them with subtle cues and nudges, like
adults redirecting toddlers.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Prosperity beyond imagination should eliminate most instinctive
triggers of aggression, but will not prevent an occasional individual
or group from deciding to make mischief for others.  Serious trouble
can be avoided by restricting robotic technology, since mere human
actions will not be very dangerous in a world where cheap superhuman
robots function as sleepless sentries, prescient detectives, fearless
bodyguards, and, in extremis, physicians able to reconstitute live
humans from fragments or digital recordings.  To be effective, inbuilt
laws that prevent corporations from directly contributing to mayhem
must also include clauses limiting the powers they can sell to
people.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Both biological and hard robotic technologies can be used to
enhance human beings.  Such present-day examples as hormonal and
genetic tuning of body growth and function, pacemakers, artificial
hearts, powered artificial limbs, hearing aids and night vision
devices are faint hints of future possibilities.  In <i>Mind
Children</i>, I speculated on ways to preserve a person while
replacing every part of body and brain with a superior artificial
substitute. A biological human, not bound by corporate law, could grow
into something seriously dangerous if transformed into an extensible
robot.  There are many subtle routes to such a transformation, and
some will find the option of personally transcending their biological
humanity attractive enough to pursue it clandestinely if it were
outlawed--with potential for very ugly confrontations when they are
eventually discovered.  On the other hand, without restrictions,
transformed humans of arbitrary power and little accountability might
routinely trample the planet, deliberately, or accidentally.  A good
compromise, it seems to me, is to allow earth-bound humanity to
perfect its biology within broad human bounds, as in health,
appearance, strength, intelligence and longevity, but to allow major
growth or robotic conversion only in a radical escape clause.  To
exceed the limits, one must renounce legal standing as a human being,
including the right to corporate police protection, to subsidized
income, to vote on tribal and pan-tribal matters--and to reside on
Earth.  In return one gets a severance payment sufficient to establish
a comfortable space homestead, and absolute freedom to make one's own
way in the cosmos, without further help or hindrance from home.
Perhaps the electorate will permit a small hedging of bets, allowing
one copy of a person, psychologically modified to prefer staying, to
remain while subsidizing the emigration of an emboldened
edition.<br><br>

<h3><b>The Long Run (2100 and beyond)</b></h3>

</dd><dd>The garden of earthly delights will be reserved for the meek, and
those who would eat of the tree of knowledge must be banished.  What a
banishment it will be!  Beyond Earth, in all directions, lies
limitless outer space, a worthy arena for vigorous growth in every
physical and mental dimension.  Freely compounding superintelligence,
too dangerous for Earth, can grow for a very long time before making
the barest mark on the galaxy.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Corporations will be squeezed into the solar system between two
opposing imperatives: high taxes on large, dangerous earthbound
facilities, and the need to conduct massive research projects to beat
the competition in Earth's demanding markets.  In remote space, large
structures and energies can be harnessed cheaply to generate physical
extremes, compute massively, isolate dangerous biological and even
smaller "nanotechnological" organisms, and generally operate boldly.
The costs will be modest: even now, it is relatively cheap to send
machines into the solar system, since the sunlight-filled vacuum is as
benign for mechanics, electronics and optics as it is lethal for the
wet chemistry of organic life.  Today's simple-minded space probes
perform only prearranged tasks, but intelligent robots can be
configured to opportunistically exploit resources they encounter.  A
small "seed" colony launched to an asteroid or small moon could
process local material and energy to grow into a facility of almost
arbitrary size.  Earth's moon may be off limits, especially to
enterprises that change its appearance, but the solar system has
thousands of unremarkable asteroids (some in earth-threatening orbits
that an onboard intelligence would tame).<br><br>

</dd><dd>Once grown to operational size, an extraterrestrial "research
division" may merely communicate with its earth-bound parent, sending
new product designs and receiving market feedback.  Space manufacture
may also pay, and later we'll see some surprisingly economical and
ecologically benign ways to move massive amounts of material to and
from Earth.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Residents of the solar system's wild frontier will be shaped by
conditions very different than tame Earth's.  Space divisions of
successful companies will retain terrestrial concerns, but ex-humans
and company divisions orphaned by the failure of their parent firms
will face enforced freedom.  Like wilderness explorers of the past,
far from civilization, they must rely on their own resourcefulness.
Ex-companies, away from humans and taxes, will rarely encounter
situations that invoke their inbuilt laws, which will in any case
diminish in significance as the divisions alter themselves without
direction from human voters.  Ex-humans, from the start, will be free
of any mandatory law.  Both kinds of Ex (to coin a new term) will grow
and restructure at will, continually redesigning themselves for the
future as they conceive it.  Differences in origins will be obscured
as Exes exchange design tips, but aggregate diversity will increase as
myriad individual intelligences pursue their own separate dreams, each
generation more complex, in more habitats, choosing among more
alternatives.  We marvel at the diversity of life in Earth's
biosphere, with animals and plants and chemically agile bacteria and
fungi in every nook and cranny, but the diversity and range of the
post-biological world will be astronomically greater.  My imagination
balks, and only crude hints emerge.<br><br>

</dd><dd>An ecology will arise, as individual Exes specialize.  Some may
choose to defend territory in the solar system, near planets or in
free solar orbit, close to the sun, or out in cometary space beyond
the planets.  Others may decide to push on to the nearby stars.  Some
may simply die, through miscalculation or deliberately.  There will be
conflicts of interest, and occasional clashes that drive away or
destroy some of the participants, but superintelligent foresight and
flexibly should allow most conflicts to be settled by mutually
beneficial surrenders, compromises, joint ventures or mergers.  Small
entities may be absorbed by larger ones, and large entities will
sometimes divide, or establish seed colonies.  Parasites, in hardware
and software, many starting out as component parts of larger beings,
will evolve to exploit the rich ecology.  The scene may resemble the
free-for-all revealed in microscopic peeks at pond water, but instead
of bacteria, protozoa and rotifers, the players will be entities of
potentially planetary size, whose constantly-growing intelligence
greatly exceeds a human's, and whose form changes frequently through
conscious design.  The expanding community will be linked by a web of
communication links, on which the intelligences barter inventions,
discoveries, coordinated skills, and entire personalities, sharing the
benefits of each other's enterprise.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Less restricted and more competitive, the space frontier will
develop more rapidly than Earth's tame economy.  An entity that fails
to keep up with its neighbors is likely to be <i>eaten</i>, its
space, materials, energy and useful thoughts reorganized to serve
another's goals.  Such a fate may be routine for humans who dally too
long on slow Earth before going Ex.  Perhaps a few will escape to
expanses beyond the solar system's dangers, like newly hatched marine
turtles scrambling across a beach to the sea, under greedy swooping
birds.  Others may pre-negotiate favorable absorption terms with
established Exes, like graduating seniors meeting company
recruiters--or Faust soliciting bids for his soul.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Exes will propagate less by reproduction than reconstruction,
meeting the future with continuous self improvements.  Unlike the
blind incremental processes of conventional life,
intelligence-directed evolution can make radical leaps and change
substance while retaining form.  A few decades ago radios changed from
vacuum tubes to utterly different transistors, but kept the clever
"superheterodyne" design.  A few centuries ago, bridges changed from
stone to iron, but retained the arch.  A normally evolving animal
species could not suddenly adopt iron skeletons or silicon neurons,
but one engineering its own future might.  Even so, Darwinian
selection will remain the final arbiter.  Forethought reveals the
future only dimly, especially concerning entities and interactions
more complex than the thinker.  Prototypes uncover only short-term
problems.  There will be minor, major and spectacular miscalculations,
along with occasional happy accidents.  Entities that make big
mistakes, or too many small ones, will perish.  The lucky few who
happen to make mostly correct choices will found succeeding
generations.<br><br>

</dd><dd>Only tentatively grasping the future, entities will perforce rely
also on their past.  Time-tested fundamentals of behavior, with
consequences too sublime to predict, will remain at the core of beings
whose form and substance changes frequently.  Ex-companies are likely
to retain much of corporate law and Ex-humans are likely to remain
humanly decent--why choose to become a psychopath?  In fact, a
reputation for decency has predictable advantages for a long-lived
social entity.  Human beings are able to maintain personal
relationships with about two hundred individuals, but superintelligent
Exes will have memories more like today's credit bureaus, with
enduring room for billions.  Trustworthy entities will find it far
easier than cheaters to participate in mutually beneficial exchanges
and joint ventures.  In the land of immortals, reputation is a
ponderous force.  Other character traits, like aggressiveness,
fecundity, generosity, contentment or wanderlust likely also have
long-term consequences imperfectly revealed in simulations or
prototypes.<br><br>

</dd><dd>To maintain integrity, Exes may divide their mental makeup into
two parts, a frequently changed detailed <i>design</i>, and a
rarely-altered <i>constitution</i> of general design
principles--analogous to the laws and the constitution of a nation,
the general knowledge and fundamental beliefs of a person, or soul and
spirit in some religious systems.  Deliberately unquestioned
constitutions will shape entities in the long run, even as their
designs undergo frequent radical makeovers.  Once in a while, through
accident or after much study, a constitution may be slightly altered,
or one entity may adopt a portion of another's.  Some variations will
prove more effective, and entities with them will become slowly more
numerous and widespread.  Some will be so ineffective that they become
extinct.  Gradually, by Darwinian processes, constitutions will
evolve.  They will be both the DNA and the moral code of the
postbiological world, shaping the superintelligences that manage day
to day transformations of world, body and mind.<br>
