# A Brief History Of The Word

Audience: people of the Internet and others

## Abstract

This talk will trace the evolutionary path of our society (just the good bits),
starting with communication, through language and the invention of the word.

I shall posit the hypothesis that the invention of the word was the first tool
that allowed us to scale our communities into world eating monstrosities.

Also, I'll talk about the internet and what I think is going to happen next.

(There may be jokes and/or juggling as well.)

## Summary

We start in the middle, with me thinking about words. As I do.
Because I'm a book nerd from back when there was no internet
(it's true kids, there was such a dark moment in our history).

And then it occurred to me, that words may be the smallest useful unit of
communication that we've invented- lots of different people live by reading,
writing, editing, reviewing, publishing, printing, advertising and interacting
with words.

Also, that the text editing that I do to make ethereally ephemeral computers
do my bidding, is in essence no different from a journalist's
(save in domain, workflow, history, politics and FUD).

There's a reason that we keep re-inventing text editors and why text editing
programs are amongst the oldest, most mature and widely deployed software we
have. Hint: it's also the reason people get religious about them.
They were and are integral to the creation, maintenance and expansion of the
Internet.

Then I thought about how far back this wordiness of ours goes and arrived at
a seemingly original hypothesis that I'd like to defend:

The word was our first tool and is the essential invention that has allowed us
to dominate this planet, which we share with our fellow animal species (aka 
natural resources).

We trace the history of the word (starting with non-verbal communications,
language, ideograms, letters, words, writing and writing things down).

We examine the current state of the art and fret about the apparent decline in
the usage of words.

We finally attempt to extrapolate existing trends to provide a speculative picture of
a machine-aided future and the inception of our signular minded robot overloads.

Then applause and AMA.
