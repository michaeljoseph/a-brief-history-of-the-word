# A Brief History Of The Word

Audience: people of the Internet and others

## Abstract

This talk will trace the evolutionary path of our society (just the good bits),
starting with communication, through language and the invention of the word.

I shall posit that the invention of a simple tool, the word, enabled us to scale
our communities into world eating monstrosities.

Also, I'll talk about the internet and what I think is going to happen next.

(There may be jokes and/or juggling as well.)

## Summary

We start in the middle, with me thinking about words. As I do.
Because I'm a book nerd from back when there was no internet
(it's true kids, there was such a dark moment in our history).

It then occurred to me- words may be the smallest useful unit of communication
that we've invented. Many people live by reading, writing, editing, reviewing,
publishing, printing, advertising and interacting with words.

The text editing that I perform (for work and play) to make ethereally
ephemeral computers do my bidding, is in essence, no different from that of a 
journalist. Or a technical writer, novelist, playwright or screenplay writer
(save in domain, workflow, history, politics and FUD).

There is a reason that we keep re-inventing text editors (Google says 'about
397,000,000 results' for 'text editor') and why text editing
programs are amongst the oldest, most mature and widely deployed software we
have. Hint: it's also the reason people get religious about them.
They were and are integral to the creation, maintenance and expansion of the
Internet.

Then I thought about how far back this wordiness of ours goes and arrived at
a seemingly original hypothesis that I'd like to defend:

    The word was our first tool and is the essential invention that has allowed
    us to dominate this planet. To the detriment of ourselves and the animal
    species we share this planet with (aka natural resources)

To establish context, I trace the history of the word. From pre- and non-verbal
communication, through language, ideograms, letters, words, writing and writing
things down.

I examine the current state of the art (this is the internet part) and fret about
the apparent decline in the usage of words.

Finally, I attempt to extrapolate existing trends to provide a speculative view
of a machine-aided future. And attempt to develop a methodology to detect and 
prepare for the coming of our robot overloads (think Zombie Apocalypse Handbook).

Then applause and AMA.
