ai resources:
- speech to text

-- everyone is researching this ()
- internet based rule engine

The twin ideas of repeated, tweaked and iterated cycles of a human virtual reality
simulation (or social network) and 

# prime source=figured out the matrix
segue:the original algorithm

Meta programming is just an expression of a computer language
which is just another language
And Ray has already taught computers how to understand our messy, involved, 
inconsistent, human lingua franca, remember?

Besides, we metaprogram all the time. All of us.  Well, most of us.

# learning is metaprogramming
- what if i told you, this line isn't in the movie
-- i have now installed this fact into your brain. Somewhere in your wetware, neurons are firing
and some bits have now been set in your head. 
<<< politics; ideas; memes; inception; dictators; force of personality and rhetoric >>>>
- we are all metaprogrammers. If you've ever picked up or dropped a habit,
or learnt a skill, you've reprogrammed yourself.
