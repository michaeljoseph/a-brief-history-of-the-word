The Law of Accelerating Returns
March 7, 2001 by Ray Kurzweil

An analysis of the history of technology shows that 
technological change is exponential, contrary to the 
common-sense "intuitive linear" view.
So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the
21st century — it will be more like 20,000 years of progress
(at today's rate)

there’s exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth

This “law of accelerating returns” applies to all of
technology, indeed to any true evolutionary process,
and can be measured with remarkable precision in information
based technologies

# dystopia, bill joy
quote from the unabomber


#38 post-singularity, AI design
ai resources:
- speech to text
- natural language processing models
-- everyone is researching this ()
- internet based rule engine
- inferences from preferences
- vision: computer drivers
- Bayes theorem using the internet as a rulebase / corpus


#38 movies: terminator, matrix
These twin ideas of repeated, tweaked and iterated cycles of a human virtual reality
simulation (or social network) and

# prime source=figured out the matrix
segue:the original

#39 consciousness
- koch: theory of consciousness
- AI: neural nets, bayes, [neuron], (un)supervised learning
  deep learning (cats on youtube)
- BCI: tan le, experiment with keyboard / game, 
- nanotech
- robotics: cheetah robot (boston dynamics)
- human brain project; brain structure; neocortical columns
- meta programming

Meta programming is just an expression of a computer language
which is just another language
And Ray has already taught computers how to understand our messy, involved,
inconsistent, human lingua franca, remember?
- tweet: reading is brain app installation
- i know kung-fu

Besides, we metaprogram all the time. All of us.  Well, most of us.

# learning is metaprogramming
- what if i told you, this line isn't in the movie
-- i have now installed this factoid into your brain. Somewhere in your wetware, neurons are firing
and some bits have now been set in your head.

<<< politics; ideas; memes; inception; dictators; force of personality and rhetoric >>>> (aristotle?)

- we are all metaprogrammers. If you've ever picked up or dropped a habit,
or learnt a skill, you've reprogrammed yourself.

# i see metaprogrammers

Watching an infant learning to walk is like watching a programmer
improve their program based on the feedback of multiple failed
executions

# unfortunately, no one can be told what the algorithm does.
  you have to run the code

## research

Google uses unsupervised learning to teach a 16K node, 1 billion connections neural net
to teach a neuron what a cat is by showing it YouTube videos
