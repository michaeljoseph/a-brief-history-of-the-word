#39 movies and motivation: terminator, matrix, the culture
The twin ideas of repeated, tweaked and iterated cycles of a human virtual reality
simulation (or social network) and

# prime source=figured out the matrix
segue:the original

#40 meta programming
Meta programming is just an expression of a computer language
which is just another language
And Ray has already taught computers how to understand our messy, involved,
inconsistent, human lingua franca, remember?

- i know kung-fu

Besides, we metaprogram all the time. All of us.  Well, most of us.

# learning is metaprogramming
- what if i told you, this line isn't in the movie
-- i have now installed this factoid into your brain. Somewhere in your wetware, neurons are firing
and some bits have now been set in your head.

<<< politics; ideas; memes; inception; dictators; force of personality and rhetoric >>>> (aristotle?)

- we are all metaprogrammers. If you've ever picked up or dropped a habit,
or learnt a skill, you've reprogrammed yourself.

# i see metaprogrammers

Watching an infant learning to walk is like watching a programmer
improve their program based on the feedback of multiple failed
executions

# unfortunately, no one can be told what the algorithm does.
  you have to run the code

## research

Google uses unsupervised learning to teach a 16K node, 1 billion connections neural net
to teach a neuron what a cat is by showing it YouTube videos
