Hi, my name is Michael, and I live on the internet.
And sometimes, late at night on the internet

I wonder about stuff. Primarily this happens in my head, but this is part
of the process of rectifying that.

Presentation habits
- looking at the projector
- I'm rambly, I talk too fast, I mumble and eat my words
- Please tell me when I'm looking at the projector

I'm lifting this slide straight out of @imsick's deck (I'm too lazy to say the whole thing). I'm hoping he won't mind
because his slide is probably much prettier than mine. He prides himself on
his beautiful slides, the little darling. Bless.

(the lost art of the opinion in today's like culture (like-fatigue)) 

This talk is opinionated, I make a few bold claims, I think that's even the title
of one of my slides [look, gaffe], make up a lot of historical sounding stuff

We start in the middle, with me thinking about words. As I do.

Because I'm a book nerd from back when there was no internet
(it's true kids, there was such a dark moment in our history).

The text editing that I perform (for work and play) to make ethereally
ephemeral computers do my bidding, is in essence, no different from that of a 
journalist. Or a technical writer, novelist, playwright or screenplay writer
(save in domain, workflow, history, politics and FUD).

There is a reason that we keep re-inventing text editors (Google says 'about
397,000,000 results' for 'text editor') and why text editing
programs are amongst the oldest, most mature and widely deployed software we
have. Hint: it's also the reason people get religious about them.
They were and are integral to the creation, maintenance and expansion of the
Internet.

It then occurred to me- words may be the smallest useful unit of communication
that we've invented. Many people live by reading, writing, editing, reviewing,
publishing, printing, advertising and interacting with words.

My bold claim (gaffe, you had one job) is that the word is our first tool. A seemingly inconsequential descendant of the far more important inventions of language and ideas you say? Well, to be precise(r), there were two related things: the invention of the letter and being able to write things down.
My claim is that there is a direct evolutionary link between the invention of the word, and the internet.

And, as people who build, maintain, benefit and profit from that wonderous invention- you know that it's words all the way down. And until very recently, very wordy at the eyeball interface level too.

Words are our best tool.
Words made the internet (which is another goodie)

To support my claim, we'll do a brief jaunt through history. A brief history of the word, as it were <falsetto>call back!</falsetto>

I'll attempt to trace the history of the word, from pre- and non-verbal
communication, through language, ideograms, letters, words, writing and writing
things down.

I examine the current state of the art (this is the internet part) and fret about
the apparent decline in the usage of words.

Finally, I attempt to extrapolate existing trends to provide a speculative view
of a machine-aided future. And attempt to develop a methodology to detect and 
prepare for the coming of our robot overloads (think Zombie Apocalypse Handbook).
