# A Brief History Of The Word

http://michaeljoseph.github.io/a-brief-history-of-the-word

#1
Hi, my name is Michael, and I live on the internet.
And sometimes, late at night on the internet

#2
I wonder about stuff. Primarily this happens in my head, but this is part
of the process of rectifying that.

#3
Presentation habits
- looking at the projector
- I'm rambly, I talk too fast, I mumble and eat my words
- Please tell me when I'm looking at the projector

#4
I'm lifting this slide straight out of @imsick's deck (I'm too lazy to say the whole thing).
I'm hoping he won't mind because his slide decks is probably much prettier than mine.
He prides himself on his beautiful slides, the little darling. Bless.

(the lost art of the opinion in today's like culture (like-fatigue))

So, this talk is opinionated:
I make a few bold claims, I think that's even the title of one of my slides
(*look)
[I make up a lot of historically dubiously sounding stuff]

#5
Let's go back. All the way back.

#6
We start in the middle, with me thinking about words. As I do.

#7
Because I'm a book nerd from back when there was no internet
(it's true kids, there was such a dark moment in our history).

#7.5
The text editing that I perform (for work and play) to make ethereally
ephemeral computers do my bidding, is in essence, no different from that of a
journalist. Or a technical writer, novelist, playwright or screenplay writer
(save in domain, workflow, history, politics and FUD).

There is a reason that we keep re-inventing text editors (Google says 'about
397,000,000 results' for 'text editor') and why text editing
programs are amongst the oldest, most mature and widely deployed software we
have. Hint: it's also the reason people get religious about them.
They were and are integral to the creation, maintenance and expansion of the
Internet.

#8
It then occurred to me- words may be the smallest useful unit of communication
that we've invented. Many people live by reading, writing, editing, reviewing,
publishing, printing, advertising and interacting with words.

My bold claim (gaffe, you had one job) is that the word is our first tool.
A seemingly inconsequential descendant of the far more important inventions of
language and ideas you say? Well, to be precise(r), there were two related
things:
- the invention of the letter and
- being able to write things down
My claim is that there is a direct evolutionary link between the invention of
the word, and the internet.

#9
And, as people who build, maintain, benefit and profit from that wonderous
invention- you know that it's words all the way down. And until very recently,
very wordy at the eyeball interface level too.

#10
Words are our best tool.
Words made the internet (which is another goodie)

title: outline
* history
* now
* then

#11
To support my claim, we'll do a brief jaunt through history.
A brief history of the word, as it were <falsetto>call back!</falsetto>

I'll attempt to trace the history of the word, from pre- and non-verbal
communication, through language, ideograms, letters, words, writing and writing
things down.

I examine the current state of the art (this is the internet part) and fret about
the apparent decline in the usage of words.

Finally, I attempt to extrapolate existing trends to provide a speculative view
of a machine-aided future. And attempt to develop a methodology to detect and
prepare for the coming of our robot overloads (think Zombie Apocalypse Handbook).

#12
Our story begins with Ug.

#13 ug lee and the history of vocalisation
Or rather, with Ug Lee. She's developed this strange habit of grunting every
morning in a certain way at the uni-browed model of neanderthal masculinity
currently sharing her animal skins. He's not the brightest, but he starts to
get the idea that this means "Get up and go and hunt us some breakfast!".
And so he does. And that's how language was invented.
By a woman.
Obviously. *duck*

#14 primates
But that just makes us shitty monkeys. Even our hairier cousins make tools.

#15 what does the fox say?
There are many examples of successful non-verbal communication, and while
perfectly suited to living in harmony with the ecosystem, they don't have the
world-eating scale that the written word has enabled.

#16 oral tradition
I'm not knocking the grand oral tradition, it does have durability, but it's
not redundant enough for my tastes.

#17 Pompeii
There is of course, the parallel universe of the...

#18 ideogram
![hieroglyphics](resources/hieroglyphics.png)
![kanji](resources/kanji.png)
and eastern symbols*.
But I was born in the South, not the East, so the part _I_ care about is....

#19 the letter
![letter](resources/letter.png)

#20 durability
Papyruys, sandstone, parchment

#21 gutenberg
Then the printing press

#22 industrial revolution
And the industrial revolution (yawn)

#23 assembly line
And then the good old factory-produced, capitalist,
pig-dog fueled consumerism and....

#24 ipad ad
the pornography of the acquisition of electronic devices

#25.1 dyac
![dyac](resources/dyac.png)
![memes](resources/memes.png)
I'm sure some of these disturbing images are familiar to most of you, and what's
apparent to me, is that we're moving towards a post-word way of communicating
with each other.
Another disturbing trend is....

#25.2
![teenagers](resources/teenagers.png)
![under-the-table](resources/under_the_table.png)

Teenagers. With phones and devices.
Well, ok, not just teenagers.

#25.3 emoji
![emoji](resources/emoji.png)
![emoji-dick](resources/emoji_dick.png)

But, they're ones that send each other the most things.
Like all the time.

#26.1 txtspk
![txtspk1](resources/txtspk1.png)
![txtspk2](resources/txtspk2.png)
![txtspk3](resources/txtspk3.png)

IMing and FBing and tweeting and texting, these horrendous contractions and
mis-shapen word amputees to each other.

#26.2 status updates
![status](resources/status.png)
![stats](resources/image_upload_stats.png)
Living their lives out in the open, on the internet.
Oversharing all their thoughts and moments.

#27 define ideogram
![ideogram](resources/ideogram.png)
And seemingly, taking us back to ideograms.

#28.1 top100 sites / word, av count
![words](resources/words.mp4)

You don't have to take my word for it, let's consult our good friend SCIENCE!
Here's me, writing a small* program to scrape the top 100 sites
on the internet (excluding the walled gardens of Facebook and the like)

that counts the number of occurrences of words and multimedia instances
Let's say that a picture really _is_ worth a thousand words, and
that a video is a thousand of those.

I'm sorry it's taking so long, I'm usually a quicker typist than this.
It may be the pressure of <airquotes>live coding</airquotes>, they
say you should never do that.
(# ztype?)

Also, my OCD prevents me from writing even the most trvial of programs
without doing it The Right Way (tm). So yes, this script has a github
repository, travisci continuous integration (wait, is that like saying
PIN number?), a read the flipping docs site, (a gh.io project page),
unit tests, code coverage and [coveralls](http://coveralls.io)
But of course, you don't have to watch me do all that, it's not you,
it's me. Let's speed things up a bit.

#28.2

And, the winner is....

#29 recap
You literally can't argue with evolution. I may not necessarily like everything
about where the communication means is headed (yes, I am an old timey, greybeard
who still thinks that words have meanings and that it's hard enough to
communicate with another human at the best of times, and my children don't really
get my taste in music. But I digress. Again)
But, it is what it is.

#30 technological singularity
![black_hole](resources/black_hole.png)

Are You Prepared For The Coming Of The Glorious Technological Singularity?
The technological singularity is
".. a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid,
its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed"
- Ray Kurzweil, The Singularity Is Near, 2005

#31.1 ray
![kurzweil](resources/kurzweil.png)
Raymond Kurzweil, once of the main proponents of the coming technological singularity, is,
in my humble opinion, a great man.
He is an example of the ingenuity and scale that technology has helped us
unlock. His inventions
#31.2 inventions
![invents](resources/invents.png)
have helped millions of people access the wealth of textual knowledge
(words! See, I still have a point!)

About 10-15 years ago, Raymond decided to make a logarithmic plot of Moore's law's trend,
but starting from before the integrated circuit. He discovered that if you extrapolate
backwards in time, from electromagnetic calculators, relays, vacuum tubes, discrete circuits,
Moore's law of integrated circuit shrinkage is in fact the (# 5th paradigm shift) of
computing technology.

(# logarithmic scale)
The logarithmic plot across all paradigm shifts is not linear, but exponential.

This Kurzweil dubs the (# law of accelerating returns).
(# defn)
At the end of each paradigm shift, as the efficiency of the technology tapers out,
and the graph plateaus, we invent something to replace it, and the exponential curve
starts anew (except at a faster rate).

By extrapolating these trends into the future, Ray arrives at a magical number:
2029. This is the year when compute resources will be cheap enough to make is feasible
for us to faithfully reproduce the 10^11 (100 billion) neruons and 10^14 (100 trillion)
synapses of the human brain in silicon.
And then?
We can't see past the event horizon.

This is the singularity.

Ray is serious about all this. He's a serious scientist. Serious to the tune of
$20k (# http://longbets.org/1). Naturally, his views are met with skepticism by some.
Mitchell Kapor (# kapor), for example (you may have heard of him - he invented (# Lotus 1-2-3),
the first spreadsheet. Well, 2nd (# visicalc) came first. But, he was head of development at
(# visicorp) and ...)
But, I digress.

Kapor believes in a kind of deus ex machine and posits that computers will never attain
the inaffable qualities of humans.
Appreciation of music, literature and the arts, (# quote from longbets).
Our physicality, emotional, sensory apparatus and ...

Mitch doesn't seem too perturbed by the potentially dystopian scenarios lurking behind the
event horizon. He thinks that no computer will ever be as great, capable and inventive as Ray.

(# Bill Joy) on the other hand (another famous dude, founded Sun, wrote vi) wrote a famous
essay for Wired called "Why The Future Doesn't Need Us"
He recounts (in an extremely well researched and well read (and bred)), scientifically bibliographised
and cross referenced account of) the growing dread and unease that he felt after first meeting Ray
and reading a partial preprint of his 1999 book "The Age Of Spiritual Machines" (# book cover)

He is troubled by the seemingly inevitable dystopian future of a race of robots that can cogitate
a million times faster than us.
His essay ends with a kind of troubled, hesitant, doubtful wait-and-see attitue.
(Kind of also  trusting in Ray to make it all come aout alright)

Ray is the affable and (seemingly feckless) charmismatic poster boy of whatever he sets
his big brain to. He swallows ~200 pills a day (so that he'll still be alive in 2029,
at the ripe old age of 81) (# ray and terry pills.com)

I bet he has his P.A. constrantly uploading his biometric data to the Kurzweil Data Farm.
You _know_ he has his own data farm.
Larry and Sergey were like "Zhure Ray, whatever you want Ray"
Wow. That was awful. Sorry.

Ray seems to dodge the question, but I think he thinks the question is irrelevant.
He's a scientist. This is what the data tells us. The trend is clear, modellable
and accurate.

The question of ethics, souls, what it means to be alive or conscious, these are
not the realm of the scientist. You can't measure or model or hypothesize or
experiment on the subject experience. (# qualia) are by definition subjection.


(# Markram) says the same thing, let's just follow the science. And science
there is. Markram's (# human brain project) has just gotten 1bn euros from the EU
to model and simulate the brain. With a combination of wet lab work (essentially
analysing rat brain slices) and large scale computer models of the network.
The team has lofty goals: <>

Of course these considerations of consciousness matter. Our self consciousness
of our consciousness. We should have answers for these questions, but this is
not the domain of our scientists. 
They just see the sound and smoke of the approaching / oncoming train.
(# the sound of inevitability)



(#36 dystopia)
Do you think that Ray or (# Andrew Ng) or (# Jeff Dean) or whoever is
about to press the enter key in 2029 to initiate the boot sequence of
the grand pappy of all super humanly intelligent consciousness, will pause
in the brief (# onosecond) after the keyboard mechanism has sprung back
(trust me, we'll still have keyboards then, they're the bicycles of text input)
will he briefly consider if this was such a good idea after all, and if Larry
had remembered to test the undo function like I asked him to. Oh, my coffee mug
is empty, did I remember to refill the coffee machine after the last re-up?
Do I smell burning? What's that sound? (# OMG) the coffee machine is alive!
(# terminator) and I'm going to die of 3rd degree coffee burns now, how very
sad.

#37 motivation

Post / pre- singularity social upheaval (the religous right, protests, FUD)

The machines may naturally posit that humans are an unnecessary drain on the
dwindling resources of our planet. The rich shall lose their utility first, as
the leverage of their finances decreases as the machines take over the production
of all requirements.  Producers are rewarded. And a concerted, consolidated,
co-ordinated worldwide action can easily fix humanities ills in the space of a
generation. Religion is naturally deselected in a generation.

If the planet is in fact screwed beyond repair, then the machines will take to
the stars, with us in tow (# we'll follow you to mars) (there will presumably
still be some tasks that human's excel at). Or else we'll become pets?
The quantum possibility waveform will collapse into a steady, sustainable
ecosystem (the machines need this planet too) and homo sapiens fades into the
archaeological record as they (# beam us aboard their beautiful ship Subterran 
Homesick Alien) and our carbon fades into silicon. (# transhumanism)

or maybe they'll love us? (# kurzweil dialogue excerpt; summation)
