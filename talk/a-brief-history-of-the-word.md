# A Brief History Of The Word

http://michaeljoseph.github.io/a-brief-history-of-the-word

#1
Hi, my name is Michael, and I live on the internet.
And sometimes, late at night on the internet

#2
I wonder about stuff. Primarily this happens in my head, but this is part
of the process of rectifying that.

#3
Presentation habits
- looking at the projector
- I'm rambly, I talk too fast, I mumble and eat my words
- Please tell me when I'm looking at the projector

#4
I'm lifting this slide straight out of @imsick's deck (I'm too lazy to say the whole thing).
I'm hoping he won't mind because his slide decks is probably much prettier than mine.
He prides himself on his beautiful slides, the little darling. Bless.

(the lost art of the opinion in today's like culture (like-fatigue))

So, this talk is opinionated:
I make a few bold claims, I think that's even the title of one of my slides
(*look)
[I make up a lot of historically dubiously sounding stuff]

#5
Let's go back. All the way back.

#6
We start in the middle, with me thinking about words. As I do.

#7
Because I'm a book nerd from back when there was no internet
(it's true kids, there was such a dark moment in our history).

#7.5
The text editing that I perform (for work and play) to make ethereally
ephemeral computers do my bidding, is in essence, no different from that of a
journalist. Or a technical writer, novelist, playwright or screenplay writer
(save in domain, workflow, history, politics and FUD).

There is a reason that we keep re-inventing text editors (Google says 'about
397,000,000 results' for 'text editor') and why text editing
programs are amongst the oldest, most mature and widely deployed software we
have. Hint: it's also the reason people get religious about them.
They were and are integral to the creation, maintenance and expansion of the
Internet.

#8
It then occurred to me- words may be the smallest useful unit of communication
that we've invented. Many people live by reading, writing, editing, reviewing,
publishing, printing, advertising and interacting with words.

My bold claim (gaffe, you had one job) is that the word is our first tool.
A seemingly inconsequential descendant of the far more important inventions of
language and ideas you say? Well, to be precise(r), there were two related
things:
- the invention of the letter and
- being able to write things down
My claim is that there is a direct evolutionary link between the invention of
the word, and the internet.

#9
And, as people who build, maintain, benefit and profit from that wonderous
invention- you know that it's words all the way down. And until very recently,
very wordy at the eyeball interface level too.

#10
Words are our best tool.
Words made the internet (which is another goodie)

title: outline
* history
* now
* then

#11
To support my claim, we'll do a brief jaunt through history.
A brief history of the word, as it were <falsetto>call back!</falsetto>

I'll attempt to trace the history of the word, from pre- and non-verbal
communication, through language, ideograms, letters, words, writing and writing
things down.

I examine the current state of the art (this is the internet part) and fret about
the apparent decline in the usage of words.

Finally, I attempt to extrapolate existing trends to provide a speculative view
of a machine-aided future. And attempt to develop a methodology to detect and
prepare for the coming of our robot overloads (think Zombie Apocalypse Handbook).

#12
Our story begins with Ug.

#13 ug lee and the history of vocalisation
Or rather, with Ug Lee. She's developed this strange habit of grunting every
morning in a certain way at the uni-browed model of neanderthal masculinity
currently sharing her animal skins. He's not the brightest, but he starts to
get the idea that this means "Get up and go and hunt us some breakfast!".
And so he does. And that's how language was invented.
By a woman.
Obviously. *duck*

#14 primates
But that just makes us shitty monkeys. Even our hairier cousins make tools.

#15 what does the fox say?
There are many examples of successful non-verbal communication, and while
perfectly suited to living in harmony with the ecosystem, they don't have the
world-eating scale that the written word has enabled.

#16 oral tradition
I'm not knocking the grand oral tradition, it does have durability, but it's
not redundant enough for my tastes.

#17 Pompeii
There is of course, the parallel universe of the...

#18 ideogram
![hieroglyphics](resources/hieroglyphics.png)
![kanji](resources/kanji.png)
and eastern symbols*.
But I was born in the South, not the East, so the part _I_ care about is....

#19 the letter
![letter](resources/letter.png)

#20 durability
Papyruys, sandstone, parchment

#21 gutenberg
Then the printing press

#22 industrial revolution
And the industrial revolution (yawn)

#23 assembly line
And then the good old factory-produced, capitalist,
pig-dog fueled consumerism and....

#24 ipad ad
the pornography of the acquisition of electronic devices

#25.1 dyac
![dyac](resources/dyac.png)
![memes](resources/memes.png)
I'm sure some of these disturbing images are familiar to most of you, and what's
apparent to me, is that we're moving towards a post-word way of communicating
with each other.
Another disturbing trend is....

#25.2
![teenagers](resources/teenagers.png)
![under-the-table](resources/under_the_table.png)
![phones-in-bowl](resources/phones_in_bowl.png)
Teenagers. With phones and devices.
Well, ok, not just teenagers.

#25.3 emoji
![emoji](resources/emoji.png)
![emoji-dick](resources/emoji_dick.png)

But, they're ones that send each other the most things.
Like all the time.

#26.1 txtspk
![txtspk1](resources/txtspk1.png)
![txtspk2](resources/txtspk2.png)
![txtspk3](resources/txtspk3.png)

IMing and FBing and tweeting and texting, these horrendous contractions and
mis-shapen word amputees to each other.

#26.2 status updates
![status](resources/status.png)
![stats](resources/image_upload_stats.png)
Living their lives out in the open, on the internet.
Oversharing all their thoughts and moments.

#27 define ideogram
![ideogram](resources/ideogram.png)
And seemingly, taking us back to ideograms.

#28.1 top100 sites / word, av count
![words](resources/words.mp4)

You don't have to take my word for it, let's consult our good friend SCIENCE!
Here's me, writing a small* program to scrape the top 100 sites
on the internet (excluding the walled gardens of Facebook and the like)

that counts the number of occurrences of words and multimedia instances
Let's say that a picture really _is_ worth a thousand words, and
that a video is a thousand of those.

I'm sorry it's taking so long, I'm usually a quicker typist than this.
It may be the pressure of <airquotes>live coding</airquotes>, they
say you should never do that.
(# ztype?)

Also, my OCD prevents me from writing even the most trvial of programs
without doing it The Right Way (tm). So yes, this script has a github
repository, travisci continuous integration (wait, is that like saying
PIN number?), a read the flipping docs site, (a gh.io project page),
unit tests, code coverage and [coveralls](http://coveralls.io)
But of course, you don't have to watch me do all that, it's not you,
it's me. Let's speed things up a bit.

#29 recap
You literally can't argue with evolution. I may not necessarily like everything
about where the communication means is headed (yes, I am an old timey, greybeard
who still thinks that words have meanings and that it's hard enough to
communicate with another human at the best of times, and my children don't really
get my taste in music. But I digress. Again)
But, it is what it is.
