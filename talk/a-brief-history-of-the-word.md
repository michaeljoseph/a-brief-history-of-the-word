Hi, my name is Michael, and I live on the internet.
And sometimes, late at night on the internet

I'm lifting this slide straight out of @imsick's deck (I'm too lazy to say the whole thing).
I'm hoping he won't mind because his slide decks is probably much prettier than mine.
He prides himself on his beautiful slides, the little darling. Bless.

(the lost art of the opinion in today's like culture (like-fatigue)) 

So, this talk is opinionated:
I make a few bold claims, I think that's even the title of one of my slides
(*look)
[I make up a lot of historically dubiously sounding stuff]

#7.5
The text editing that I perform (for work and play) to make ethereally
ephemeral computers do my bidding, is in essence, no different from that of a 
journalist. Or a technical writer, novelist, playwright or screenplay writer
(save in domain, workflow, history, politics and FUD).

There is a reason that we keep re-inventing text editors (Google says 'about
397,000,000 results' for 'text editor') and why text editing
programs are amongst the oldest, most mature and widely deployed software we
have. Hint: it's also the reason people get religious about them.
They were and are integral to the creation, maintenance and expansion of the
Internet.

It then occurred to me- words may be the smallest useful unit of communication
that we've invented. Many people live by reading, writing, editing, reviewing,
publishing, printing, advertising and interacting with words.

My bold claim (gaffe, you had one job) is that the word is our first tool.
A seemingly inconsequential descendant of the far more important inventions of
language and ideas you say? Well, to be precise(r), there were two related
things:
- the invention of the letter and
- being able to write things down
My claim is that there is a direct evolutionary link between the invention of
the word, and the internet.

And, as people who build, maintain, benefit and profit from that wonderous
invention- you know that it's words all the way down. And until very recently,
very wordy at the eyeball interface level too.

To support my claim, we'll do a brief jaunt through history.
A brief history of the word, as it were <falsetto>call back!</falsetto>

I'll attempt to trace the history of the word, from pre- and non-verbal
communication, through language, ideograms, letters, words, writing and writing
things down.

I examine the current state of the art (this is the internet part) and fret about
the apparent decline in the usage of words.

Finally, I attempt to extrapolate existing trends to provide a speculative view
of a machine-aided future. And attempt to develop a methodology to detect and 
prepare for the coming of our robot overloads (think Zombie Apocalypse Handbook).

#13 ug lee and the history of vocalisation
Or rather, with Ug Lee. She's developed this strange habit of grunting every
morning in a certain way at the uni-browed model of neanderthal masculinity
currently sharing her animal skins. He's not the brightest, but he starts to
get the idea that this means "Get up and go and hunt us some breakfast!".
And so he does. And that's how language was invented.
By a woman.
Obviously. *duck*

#15 what does the fox say?
There are many examples of successful non-verbal communication, and while
perfectly suited to living in harmony with the ecosystem, they don't have the
world-eating scale that the written word has enabled.

#29 recap
You literally can't argue with evolution. I may not necessarily like everything
about where the communication means is headed (yes, I am an old timey, greybeard
who still thinks that words have meanings and that it's hard enough to 
communicate with another human at the best of times, and my children don't really
get my taste in music. But I digress. Again)
But, it is what it is.
